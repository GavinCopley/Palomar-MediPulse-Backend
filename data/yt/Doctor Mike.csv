Is there a health risk to getting a 6 hour massage? Hypothetically, would Spongebob Squarepants bleed out from an injury or just absorb his lost blood because he’s a sponge? Is a dentist qualified to help you with a tongue problem or are they not trained in all areas of the mouth, just the teeth? What would happen if a child needed surgery and only one of the parents consented to it? Say the mom said yes but the dad said no? Why is back pain so common? What’s wrong with us? Where does the air from a burp come from? Am I burping out air from my lungs or is there air in my stomach? What’s Bear’s salary? To become a doctor don’t you just have to win the genetic lottery that you’re smart enough? Okay Doctor Mike, you say there are risks of PFAS exposure… but what about PWOOP exposure?

What would happen if you administered an epi pen for someone who wasn’t in anaphylactic shock? Would it juice them up with super powers? Why do left handed people die sooner? I love swimming in the summer but I’m always getting swimmers ear. What can I do to prevent it? I’ve heard that the magnet(s) forcefield is STRONG! If someone has metal rods in their back can they still have an MRI or is that too dangerous? Could the force of an MRI actually pull the rods out of the body? What happens when you get a lymphatic drainage massage?? Are the benefits real? What're your least favorite medical terminology or medicine names? Why do elderly people get confused when they have a UTI? How often do you have to retake your boards? Suggestions for running on heat during the summer time? Would putting a wet shirt in the freezer than wearing it be too much of a temp change on your body? Any other suggestions? What exactly is “added sugar”? I see the label on some food says “zero added sugar” but the ingredients list says sugar. What’s the difference? Do you pee more when you’re stressed or nervous? I feel like I do. I’ve got some international travel coming up and the jet lag always kicks my butt. Any tips to help fight it? How dangerous is iron poisoning from fish? Isn’t fish way healthier than red meat?

Ginny and I are great friends and coworkers, but we developed a new type of relationship this last year where Ginny actually became one of my patients. You see, Ginny was suffering from debilitating pain in her back, and after hearing her side of the story, I realized I wasn't happy with her treatment plan. So, I made Ginny book an appointment with me so we could get to the bottom of her pain. This turned out to be an excellent decision for many reasons detailed in this episode. We don't just talk about Ginny's health though, but also do a deep dive into our relationship and Ginny's opinions on the healthcare system as a nurse who has seen it all, and then some, in over 40 years on the front lines. 00:00 Intro 01:10 Our First Meeting / Fight 04:50 How Ginny Started 14:05 What Makes Doctors Special 19:31 What Nurses Actually Do 24:36 Memories Of Me 31:30 Flirting With Doctors 33:25 Ginny Going Viral 35:18 Ginny’s Injury 52:10 Ginny’s Retirement / My Boxing 54:48 Advice For Nurses Help us continue the fight against medical misinformation and change the world through charity by becoming a Doctor Mike Resident on Patreon where every month I donate 100% of the proceeds to the charity, organization, or cause of your choice!

On paper, it's pure theater with rehearsed and choreographed wrestling matches. In reality... it turns out there are some pretty brutal injuries that actually occur. Today I decided to look at a series of real injuries that plagued wrestlers. We look at Logan Paul's torn MCL in his knee, John Cena's broken nose, Bianca Belair's hair whip and black eye, Bret Hart's career-ending concussion, Candice Michelle's broken collarbone, Cody Rhodes pectoral tear, Randy Orton's separated shoulder, Dwayne The Rock Johnson's torn adductors, Triple H's dry ice burns, Stone Cold Steve Austin's broken neck, and the unforgettable 16 foot fall from Mick Foley at the hand of The Undertaker.

Fame, money, and glory are all things Joey wanted, but it turns out they came at an unexpected cost. I was a huge fan of Joey's and after circling each other for years we finally pulled off an interview so I could get inside the head of this upstate New York kid from the inner city. We discussed his extreme battle with mental health and addiction, his bruised upbringing boxing in Syracuse, the incredible drive he had to be an actor in Hollywood, and how pivoting to a life in reality tv was one of the most unexpected and fascinating decisions he's ever made.

I also wanted to clarify that I KNOW many of you are annoyed that I reacted to the English dubs and that you prefer watching with the original Japanese VO. I get it. The reason I do that is because I've learned over the years these videos become kind of unwatchable when you're forced to read English subtitles... while listening to Japanese voices... while listening to my voice... while reading on screen text... at the quick speed the videos play at... and with many of you turning on captions anyway. It's sensory overload. So, no need to angry comments about captions, I understand! And hopefully now you see why I did it this way. 00:00 Demon Slayer 02:42 One Punch Man 04:44 Pokemon 06:06 Attack On Titan 8:54 Boruto: Naruto Next Generation 11:17 Dragonball Z Help us continue the fight against medical misinformation and change the world through charity by becoming a Doctor Mike Resident on Patreon where every month I donate 100% of the proceeds to the charity, organization, or cause of your choice!

They've done deep dives on intermittent fasting, infant feeding, COVID vaccines... you name it. I invited them on the show to discuss some issues that have been on my mind lately, especially surrounding the way medical experts have been communicating with each other on social media.

This line from one of Steven's videos hit a meteoric viral rise in the summer of 2022, but unlike many viral stars who are a flash in the pan, Steven was ready. His years of hustling as a working actor and content creator allowed him to run with his success and build a rapidly growing audience of people who enjoy his ""Off Brand"" TikToks or YouTube shorts about his most popular character known only as ""Asian Dad"". Steven has big plans for the future with the impending release of his original series ""Ginormo"" and a seemingly never-ending waterfall of fresh content across social media.

I can't, because nothing he said was incorrect.

The first was a man suffering from a hyper rare case of toxic shock syndrome which resulted in him losing a lot of his body. His recovery was truly inspiring. The next was a man who sustained a near-fatal motorcycle accident that caused him to lose his voice. Doctors invented a procedure that allowed him to receive a vocal box transplant. Today he can speak just like you or me. The final story is about a 40 year old man who appears to occupy the body of a small child.

That search has yielded some takeaways for me though, and I'm not ready to throw in the towel on my boxing career just yet. I wanted to share the entire boxing experience from traveling to Arizona at the Gila River Arena thanks to an invite from Jake Paul and Most Valuable Promotions.

Listen to the full episode on: • Spotify: https://go.doctormikemedia.com/spotify/CheckUpSpotify • Apple Podcasts: https://go.doctormikemedia.com/applepodcast/ApplePodcasts Buy Kal's book here: https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/You-Cant-Be-Serious/Kal-Penn/9781982171391 In my first ever podcast episode, I talked to Kal Penn, who has one of the strangest resumes in Hollywood. You most likely remember Kal as half of the stoner comedy duo “Harold and Kumar”, or if you’ve watched a lot of medical dramas like I have you may have enjoyed his 2 season arc on House MD where he lit a patient on fire instead of doing chest compressions. But if your name is “Barack Obama” (hey Prez, check your DMs, come on the show?) you may instead remember Kal as a full time staff member at the White House. Huh? President Obama hired the White Castle guy, after he was already famous? That’s right. Your tax dollars paid his salary for years as a full time staff member of the White House Office of Public Engagement. Turns out the roller coaster ride of Kal’s life didn’t end with him sitting at the movie premiere for Van Wilder, next to his strict Indian immigrant parents, watching his oiled body slide off a naked woman while playing a character literally named “Taj Mahal” (yikes). In Kal’s new book, You Can’t Be Serious, he not only details some of the stunning racism he’s faced throughout his 20+ years in Hollywood, but also stories of those late nights in Washington DC working alongside President Obama navigating some of America’s most highly controversial political issues, such as the hurdles they had to clear to remove the army’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, which barred openly queer people from serving in the armed forces. I asked Kal about all of these big picture stories, as well as some smaller ones, like how it’s possible he walks around every day with a tattoo on his left arm that has a typo.

As A Patient","I have been struggling with a series of injuries over the last several months. I decided to take this treatment into my own hands. I visited a highly-rated acupuncturist in the city who used a new needle technique I've never experienced. This made a huge improvement on the pain I was suffering in my elbow, but I quickly realized a new problem had emerged. There was horrible nerve pain now in my arm. This was very scary as it prevented me from doing several things, and as someone aggressively pursuing a boxing career, I was scared my future was jeopardized. I waited several weeks for the pain to subside, but it never did. So, I looked up a specialist in NYC who could help me. I went online and found a doctor with amazing reviews, a great website, and clips online that gave me a lot of confidence he could help me. So, I booked a quick appointment and went in to get help. This turned out to be the weirdest doctor/patient encounter I've ever experienced. Have you ever had an uncomfortable encounter with your doctor?

I'm a big fan of both Mark and Hot Ones, so don't think this makes me any less of a fan, but I do believe it's important to call out medical misinformation when it appears on such a larger platform from such influential people. To combat the pain of the heat, Mark used Chloraseptic Throat Numbing Spray. The instructions on the back of the bottle state you should not use more than 5 sprays per every 2 hours for adults. Mark and Sean Evans clearly used it dozens of times, and even appeared to swallow it, which you're not supposed to do. The FDA has actually issued warnings about this.

In the early 2000s, filmmaker Morgan Spurlock challenged himself to eat nothing but food from McDonalds for an entire month. He had witnessed the explosion of fast food in America, and with growing numbers about obesity and other weight-related health issues, he wanted to do an experiment and see what would happen to his body if he only ate from the Golden Arches. Despite his doctors stern warnings of the risks involved, he did it anyway, and the results are fascinating. I remember seeing this movie long before I was a doctor, but now that I am a practicing physician, I wanted to watch it again with a fresh perspective. Big Macs, gigantic cokes, mountains of fries, apple pies... you name it, he ate it. I have some strong opinions about the methods used in producing this doc, as well as our current conversations around weight in this country, and I'm sure you do to!

When I turned 6 my parents told me the next day we would be moving to America and leaving Russia behind forever. I've resisted going into detail about this story because it's so personal to me, but I finally decided to share it so you all can get to know where I come from and what shaped me. What better way to do that with a draw my life/animation video? The journey wasn't easy. Along with navigating the complicated process of immigrating to the United States, I didn't speak a word of English, had to go to a new school, and assimilate to an entirely new culture, all while both of my parents worked nights and weekends to keep food on the table and create a better life for me and my sister.

Of course, in classic Ryan fashion, he is only allowing him to travel with funds he's profited from a single penny he started with in Los Angeles. He's about halfway through the biggest challenge in YouTube history, raising money for Feeding America along the way. The highest possible perk for raising money was the opportunity to pick a tattoo for Ryan to get on his body... if you donated $100,000. So... I did. I don't want to be selfish and have all the fun myself though, so I came up with 4 tattoo ideas and YOU get to decide which one will be placed on his body forever.

Today we talk about drowning, CPR, chest compressions, the difference between CPR on land and in the sea, dislocated fingers, dislocated hips, seizures, diabetes, blue bottles or jellyfish stings, scrapes, and all other injuries that can occur when surfing or swimming in the ocean.

We’re so proud of this variety show about medicine and the human body, full of improv, game shows, and furry guests (come on, you know we had to bring Bear)! We visited The Wilbur Theatre in Boston, Capital Turnaround in Washington DC, The Fillmore in Philadelphia, and The Count Basie Center For The Arts in Red Bank, NJ, as the first trial of what this show is and how we like touring life. Believe me, it had so many ups and downs. From the incredible highs of meeting fans during VIP meet and greets and rapping about vaccination on stage, to the brutal lows of Bear and I actually getting kicked off a plane and being forced to drive to DC. This video gives you an exciting look behind the scenes to see what tour life is like and how hard we all worked on pulling this show off. No matter how hard we worked to make it, we truly couldn’t have done it without you all getting vaccinated and coming out in person. I’m so excited about expanding this tour and meeting more of you across the country and around the world!

Tickets for the in person event and stream here: https://thecreatorclash.com/ Over the last several months I have dedicated my time to training for my boxing debut, taking place Saturday May 14th in Tampa, Flordia against my fellow YouTuber, iDubbbz. While my support network has been strong, from friends and family to my professional coaching/nutrition team, I've still received a lot of confused looks and comments from people when I tell them I'm getting ready to fight. Why would a doctor, who knows the real risks that come with boxing, volunteer to participate in such a dangerous sport? Today I want to tell you why I'm driven to the sport and how I'm taking care of myself to limit the very real risks of fighting as much as possible. CTE is real, brain damage is real, lifelong trauma is real. Despite what iDubbbz might have said about me on the H3H3 podcast, I am taking this training seriously, and I think you'll all see what I mean come May 14th ;) I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously.

The Try Guys did take things a step further though, enlisting the help of a medical team and series of tests to determine not only who has the healthiest lifestyle, but to predict who will die first and live the longest. I've got to say, I have some very mixed feelings about these types of test, as there are so many variables in what leads to a long and healthy life that a test simply doesn't take into consideration, but it's a fun exercise to explore nonetheless. Today we hit on a bunch of subjects, such as Ned Fulmer having a baby with his wife and becoming a dad, Keith Habersberger's diet after eating the whole menu, Eugene Lee Yang's alcohol intake, and Zach Kornfeld's STI concerns, among many other things.

Today we talk about sleeping with your make up on, toxic lipstick, toxic nail polish, children/teen make up use, healthier vs. unhealthier make ups, SPF in your make up, anti-aging wrinkle cremes, washing your brushes, restoring your expired mascara, expired make up, using your fingers instead of a brush, and moisturizer on oily skin.

Along with winning best picture for new-coming writer, director, and actor, Sylvester Stallone, in 1976, the film inspired 5 sequels and the spinoff film series “Creed” starring Michael B. Jordan. As an up and coming boxer myself, I thought I’d take a look at the work of Rocky Balboa to see if he included medical accuracy in his boxing epic based out of Philadelphia. Carl Weathers playing Apollo Creed, Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago… not to mention Mickey, Adrian, Paulie, and so many other characters come into play here as we look at the injuries Rocky sustained and delivered. Specifically we look into broken hands, broken noses, broken ribs, brain trauma and CTE, drinking raw eggs, using raw meat as punching bags, running stairs, “cut-men” steroids, blood doping, hematomas, chasing a chicken for speed training, banning boxing, Cavum Septum Pellucidum, Which Rocky movie is your favorite?

He presented with fatigue, joint paint, body aches, and recent rashes. After seeing several physicians across multiple appointments, this patient was feeling confused and frustrated regarding his diagnosis and treatment plan. He and I dug a little deeper and eventually got to the truth. Unfortunately, many physicians engage in a form of fatphobia and fat shaming where they immediately attribute any issue a patient has to their weight. While excessive weight can lead to or be a contributing factor to a wide variety of health issues, the fact of the matter is your size does not inherently dictate your health. I’m glad this patient and I were able to think critically and do a little medical detective work together to identify this issue and bring him back to full health.

While many of these conditions may appear humorous to some, it's important to lead with empathy and recognize these are stories of real people, often times suffering from life-threatening conditions. Today we look at a young woman addicted to drinking gasoline, a man who spends 8 hours a day dressed and behaving like a baby, a girl addicted to eating sand, a man who is romantically in love with his car, a man whose primary diet consists of bugs, a woman obsessed with scavenging for expired food, and the world's strongest family.

Additional evidence shows that serial antigen testing every 3 days, or twice per week, will almost always identify SARS-CoV-2 during early stages of infection, and thus significantly reduce disease transmission. Thus, if resources allow, serial antigen testing is a potentially important public health practice along with other prevention strategies.” Help us continue the fight against medical misinformation and change the world through charity by becoming a Doctor Mike Resident on Patreon where every month I donate 100% of the proceeds to the charity, organization, or cause of your choice!

Visit https://SimpliSafe.com/doctormike to learn more! I’ve answered hundreds if not thousands of your medical questions on this channel, and I’m getting burnt out. So I thought I’d build a Doctor Mike robot, teach him to speak and think like I do, and see if he could answer questions for me. The results were… mixed. Today we talk about acne scars, passing out at the sight of blood, diabetes, stitches, breast milk for bodybuilding, LEGOs, medical school, therapy, helium, natural deodorant vs. aluminum, how to sleep, fever reduction, sunscreen, ringing ears, staring at your phone, and some sicko who wants to buy Bear. This video isn’t one big joke, we actually pulled this off for real. I got in contact with a software engineer who specializes in Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3, an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. We took the caption files of all of the videos on the Doctor Mike channel, fed them into this learning program, and it used those words as the foundation for artificial intelligence. The program is also capable of responding to questions, so after it “learned” how I speak, we fed it actual questions you have sent in and these were the responses. Each question resulted in 5-10 responses, many of which were nonsense and unintelligible. However, there was at least one clear response for each question, which is what you see in this video today. Seeing how this robot responds using my language gives me some job security that AI won’t take over medicine any time soon, but I would be curious to see how the robot would respond if you fed it several medical textbooks, as it seems lots of my natural human speech about non-medicine over the years likely threw the robot for a loop.

Ryan Garcia","Ryan Garcia is an undefeated boxer based out of San Diego. As someone who has trained as a boxer for the last 10 years, I was curious to know what someone who makes a living in the ring thinks of my skills. So, I flew to San Diego to work with Ryan and his trainer (and father) Henry to show them what I’ve got. Along with kicking my butt through a series of grueling drills, I also took on Ryan’s Body Shots Challenge where he slammed me in the stomach as many times as I could handle (with the help from a pad of course), as well as his Punch Tracker Challenge where they see how many punches I can land on a bag in just 10 seconds. By the end Ryan said not only did I impress him, but that he thinks I could take on Logan AND Jake Paul in the same night! I don’t know if I’d go that far, but I’m definitely eyeing participating in my first real fight, the only question is… against who?

I hope to keep battling medical misinformation and reacting to medical memes and dramas well beyond 40, folks, so it was time for a change. Over the last month I have done a complete overhaul of my entire diet to reduce my LDL cholesterol, but it hasn’t been easy. The most difficult part of the diet was not cutting out foods high in saturated fats that clog your arteries, but rather finding foods allowing me to consume upwards of 60 grams of fiber a day.

So, I compiled all of the punches, shots, wounds, kicks, falls, and everything in between into one video to assess how accurate the conflict in John Wick really is. Keanu Reeves is an awesome actor, but no matter how good he is, there’s only so much belief I can suspend. Specifically, we talk about concussions, broken noses, solar plexus, bone bruises, GI disturbances, GSW’s, bleeding out, MCL tears, blisters, thyroids, stapling a wound, vertebral fractures, blood clotting, dislocated thumbs, suffocation, femur strength, sutures, and bad Russian.

These doctors can be selfish, greedy, ignorant, or just downright mean. Whether they’re trying to sell you their own miracle cure, refusing to perform a physical exam, or judging your lifestyle, these doctors should be sent back to med school for some extra education.

The show is set at an American Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, or MASH, in Korea during the Korean War of the 1950's. Starring Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce, an army surgeon who likes to play by his own rules, the show was a massive success, culminating in the most highly-watched series finale of all time, garnering 106 million viewers.

These old wives’ tales have been around for generations, and it’s time we put them to the test to see what’s true and what isn’t. I collabed with TikTok’s grandma, GB (Grandma Bobbe) to provide some insight into the medical murkiness of things like swallowing your gum, frowns vs. smiles, chicken noodle soup curing a cold, not exercising when sick, cracking your knuckles, raw meat on bruises, plucking hairs, watermelon seeds, crossing your eyes, sugar making you hyper, sitting close to the tv, snacking and ruining your appetite, carrots being good for your eyes, and sucking your thumb.

There are even more benign injuries such as a gymnast stepping onto a nail with her bare foot… which naturally leads to a disaster where another gymnast incorrectly dismounts from a bar and mangles all of their limbs on the mat below. I decided to dive deep into Final Destination to react to these “injuries” and see if there is anything to be learned from a medical perspective so we don’t accidentally break a machine in the weight room and smash our heads between the plates.

Treating our minds is just as important as treating our bodies, so if you or a loved one is in need of resources for mental health care, please visit the National Alliance On Mental Illness: https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Treatments To that end, I decided to explain what are known as the 10 Cognitive Distortions. These are lenses in which we view and analyze the world that commonly lead to inaccurate, toxic, and dangerous thoughts. Jumping to conclusions, over-generalization, discounting the positive… all examples of distortions that twist the reality of what you’re receiving. These occur with major life events like break ups/heartbreak/divorce or losing a job, as well as everyday occurrences like traffic or getting snubbed on the street. Knowledge is power, and with an understanding of these 10 things, hopefully you’ll be prepared to fend off the distortions when they inevitably present themselves.

He’s extremely creative with his engineering, building robots that do all sorts of hilarious things. He’s made a roomba that screams when it hits something, a microwave powered by screams, an electric chair that tasers you if you can’t find Waldo fast enough. Come to think of it, most of Michaels inventions are somehow scream-related. Unfortunately, Michael is no stranger to scream-inducing pain himself, as he revealed his scary history with a bladder problem that nearly left him passed out on the floor of a Hawaii shopping mall. I wanted to set the record straight with Michael over the “popping” sound that emerged from inside him, the frequency of his urination, his “p-i-s cup” invention, and the claims people make that his urine “turned black.""

Dr. Seema Yasmin","At long last, the COVID-19 vaccine is finally here and the long distribution has begun. Today, I sat down with Dr. Seema Yasmin from the Stanford Center for Health Education to demystify any ambiguity about this vaccine, such as how effective it is, the side effects, and which groups are eligible. We also dove into the science of how the Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna vaccines actually work, the technicals of mRNA, and whether the vaccine is safe for children. Have any more questions about the vaccine? Drop them below and I’ll try to answer as many as I can.

Just because I work in a hospital doesn’t mean I truly understand the every day hustle of being a nurse though, so I brought on my friend Bianca Antisera, a traveling trauma nurse, to share her insight. There were a lot of puzzling choices in this pilot episode, from unethical blood donations, patient privacy violations, and the bizarre premise that everyone in a hospital is throwing shade all day long.

Honestly, I’m not a fan of the title of this show, but I decided to press on anyway and see if there was anything valuable to discuss. At his heaviest, Casey weighed 845 pounds and almost never left his father’s house where he stayed in bed and played video games all day. Today, Casey is employed, living on his own, and weighs under 300 pounds. His journey is nothing short of incredible, due in part to a supportive family, a strong medical team, bariatric surgery, and a commitment to improving his quality of life. Go, Casey!

Other things, such as making sure you pee before you get inside ANY car… are a little too much for me. At the end I also share 3 ways I’ve changed my life based on my interactions with patients, including thoughts on skin cancer and coffee and alcohol consumption. Let me know down below if you think any of these will change the way you go about your daily life!

The study aimed to identify “clearly unprofessional content” shared on social media by young vascular surgeons, such as HIPAA violations and criminal activity. Unfortunately, the study’s 3 male investigators also looked for “potentially unprofessional content” which included doctors posting photos holding alcoholic beverages and “provocative posing in bikinis/swimwear”. I was outraged by the gender bias in this study holding female doctors to a double standard, essentially saying if you’re a doctor or a woman in medicine you don’t get to enjoy legal activities such as having a glass of wine or taking a photo at the beach. I wasn’t alone, as the medical community on twitter came together with the hashtag #medbikini to denounce this study, and just the other day it was actually retracted by the journal. While that’s definitely a win, we need to continue to empower our medical professionals to live normal lives without fear of being authentic on social media, as it’s better for our mental health and truly helps us connect better with our patients. Read the retracted study for yourself here: https://www.jvascsurg.org/action/showPdf?pii=S0741-5214%2819%2932587-X Thank you to surgeon Dr. Daisy Sanchez (@ladaisysanchez) for allowing me to use her photo in our thumbnail!

This was really hard for me to read and caused me to take a critical look back at my previous comments regarding obesity, bariatric treatments, and diet recommendations (Keto, intermittent fasting, vegan, etc.) Our culture demonizes people for their weight, from rogue marketing pushing “ideal bodies” in media to a lack of representation for large bodied people on stage and on screen. That being said, I am a doctor, and my job is to help people live longer, healthier lives, and often those results can be achieved through a variety of tactics that will reduce the weight of people who suffer from obesity. It’s a fine line between helping my patients and making sure they don’t feel judged or criticized for the way they look, and I’m working hard to get it right.

Medical memes or Doctor Memes are a great way to get a laugh whether or not you are part of the medical community. I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be dark and if taken out of context can even seem offensive BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. MORE Medical Memes: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJRbJuI_csVDOmeEsBumpBhm-hDMCAprj I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. #DoctorMikeMedicalMemeReview As they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together!

Medical memes or Doctor Memes are a great way to get a laugh whether or not you are part of the medical community. I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be dark and if taken out of context can even seem offensive BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. #DoctorMikeMedicalMemeReview As they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together!

Medical memes or Doctor Memes are a great way to get a laugh whether or not you are part of the medical community. I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be dark and if taken out of context can even seem offensive BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. #DoctorMikeMedicalMemeReview As they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together!

This one is called ""disgusting science"" where you make slime snot, stomach simulations, and more! I would give this kit 3.5/5 stars as it does a great job of teaching basic science/health concepts through the activities and even has solid explanations. However, the kit has few tools and you need A LOT of supplemental equipment like bread, vinegar, containers, etc. If you are looking to learn some basic health and have some laughs making slime through science this can be a good kit for you to check out. Ari and I definitely shared more than one laugh on this simple science experiment. As they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together!

I think it’s a fun game that requires a lot of communication and teamwork so I’ve been playing it for a few months. I also do think it’s important to show you a true silly side of myself because doctors are humans too and we like to have fun and joke around. Gaming has always been a hobby of mine when I have the time and it is a great stress buster for me. But don’t you worry as health content will be back for the next video this Sunday! When doing this video I thought about including pros and cons of playing video games on your health but I thought that would be better done in a stand alone video. If you guys are interested in the health effects of gaming, both good and bad, let me know in the comments section.

This is 27 minutes long but I felt wrong to cut anything out of it as it all seemed relevant and important. This video is almost a completely unedited conversation we had when we first sat down to record the original Ask Doctor Mike video you saw a few weeks ago. We discuss the rise of anxiety and depression as well as some of the inaccurate portrayal of mental health currently in media. If you have comments or questions based on this video please do drop them down below so that I can address them. Please Follow The Gabbie Show and be on the lookout for her Vegan video that we collabed on as well!!! https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGabbieShow If you want me to collab with a YouTuber you enjoy watching please jump into the comments and let me know. Also, Twitter is a great place to connect us so visit my socials, down right down below. Love you all! If you or a loved one is in immediate danger calling 911 and talking with police may be necessary. It is important to notify the operator that it is a psychiatric emergency and ask for an officer trained in crisis intervention or trained to assist people experiencing a psychiatric emergency.

I have been seeing patient's come in with all sorts of unexplained symptoms including chronic pain for years without a clear root cause. Understanding that the mind and body are intimately connected is extremely important in being able to help patients. A holistic approach mean a whole (hol-) person approach. That means in order to treat any condition appropriately I need to ask my patients questions tied to their mental health as well. My recommendation are to: 1) Have a Primary Care Doctor (don't rely on Urgent Cares to give you Holistic care) 2) Establish an honest, open relationship with your Primary Doc 3) Take time out of your day to be mindful of your emotions (especially if they seem to be buried deep). https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/crisis-knocks/201007/mind-body-md-looks-emotion-behind-chronic-pain https://patient.info/health/psychosomatic-disorders Please check out my other videos as we cover all sorts of subjects including nutrition, mental health, supplements, and more on my channel!

Lately, I've noticed a huge uptick in these stories and many if not all of them have great intentions. However, I have seen some questionable information floating around and it's leading me to share this concern with you guys. Even when someone wants to do something good it can lead to some unwanted consequences. Take for instance the peanut allergy situation. Parents tried protecting their children from peanuts so much so that it actually caused a spike in allergies. Now we know exposing children early on to peanuts is beneficial. This is just one example of when good intentions can lead to bad outcomes. The mental health conversation is getting a lot of buzz lately and patients have come into my office having what I call anxiety on anxiety. They are literally being anxious about their feelings of anxiety (even when they are totally appropriate). Also, many have self-diagnosed themselves from media (often incorrectly) and it takes a great deal of work and convincing to get them to let those thoughts go. Diagnosing a mental illness is complex and takes time. This is why it is best to go see your doctor to get a full examination and have an open discussion about what's going on in your life. If you or a loved one is in immediate danger calling 911 and talking with police may be necessary. It is important to notify the operator that it is a psychiatric emergency and ask for an officer trained in crisis intervention or trained to assist people experiencing a psychiatric emergency.

The discovery of the microbiome has started off a huge cascade of new research as well as the launch of some questionable health products. I think that the idea that we are covered inside and out by bacteria, with the majority of it being helpful, is pretty mind-blowing. I decided to make this video because I've seen your comments and questions on the subject, usually in the in the form of ""how can I improve my gut?"" Also, I've noticed that my patients have begun taking these supplements to cure everything from a weight gain, to a weakened immune system to acne. As you probably already know I am a healthy skeptic and believe that just because we see some correlations between disease and good bacteria it is not as simple as putting those bacteria into a capsule. I firmly believe in the next 20-30 years we will unlock some fascinating secrets about our gut that will redefine how we think about our health.

This is the first medical show I’ve ever known about and watched. I remember being a youngin watching George Clooney and wondering what it would be like to actually be a doctor. Now I am a doctor so I’ve decided to share with you what I think about the pilot episode. We have to keep in mind this show is about 2 decades old and a lot has changed in the medical space but it is still incredibly accurate. I love the character development and writing in this show because it does feel authentic to what happens during hospital hours. I guess you can say that I am a fan and that ER is accurate! Anyway, I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches ER / Real Doctor Reacts to ER.

The episode ""three stories"" kept popping up with a lot of upvotes. I didn't get any background behind the story of the episode and I just sat down and watched it. Now I didn't know it was going to be such a complicated episode to review as it bounced back and forth between three situations. So to simplify we decided to completely remove one of the three patient simulations as we felt it didn't add much to the story and just made it. more complicated for you to follow. I wish I knew this was the episode that went on to explain what is wrong with House's leg because then maybe I would've saved it for a later review. But I guess its good for me to know for further episodes anyway. I will say this about Dr. House. I think he is a kind guy that comes off brash almost on purpose to be a better doctor. You can totally sense throughout the episodes that I've watched that he is still angry for his decision made in this episode.

What you put into your body can directly impact your overall health. When you're ordering food all the time you have no control over what ingredients are used, and that's why cooking at home can be your best option. Meal prep services are super popular because they lay it all out for you and make it easy to create meals from your own kitchen.

I know that the series has multiple shows airing simultaneously like Chicago p.d. and Chicago fire, so this gave me hope that the Chicago Med will be pretty good since they have experience in making these types of shows. Chicago Med is surprisingly fresh. It had all the attributes of a quality medical drama. Unique medical conditions that inherently bring drama to the screen. Solid actors and actresses. Good character development, without that much romantic drama. Although I'm sure it will come in the later episodes (please correct me if I'm wrong). This show pleasantly surprised me and left me wanting to watch another episode. Basically, the question I am answering in this description is how accurate is Chicago Med.

After watching several of these tv dramas I feel like writers are really trying to force some of these concepts and it shows. I know this is the medical drama review series but man this show was so over the top it is crazy. Grey's anatomy is even more toned down and realistic than the stuff that went on during this pilot. I'm all for a little juicy hospital drama but the night shift really feels like its going too far. I mean the lead actor/doctor actually hits a hospital administrator and another doctor MMA chokes a patient and no one even gets in trouble. How unrealistic can it get??? Basically, the question I am answering in this description is how accurate is the night shift . The answer is ehhh. =] Anyway, I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches The Night Shift / Real Doctor Reacts to the Night Shift . If you want me to continue making this doctor reaction video please give it a like and leave me a comment on which tv drama or show you'd like for me to review next. Love you all!

I am back with the next installment of my diet review series. This week I am covering the incredibly popular ketogenic diet. Within the last year or two, the keto diet has soared in popularity and I can understand why. It is a simple diet where counting calories isn't important (who wants to count calories) and you get to eat a bunch of really delicious foods. If you are curious, the name of the diet comes from the ketone bodies produced within your body as a result of switching your body to fuel itself through fats instead of carbs. This is also referred to as a state of ketosis. Video Breakdown: Opener- 0:23 Nutrition Basics- 0:28 How it Works- 1:05 Keto Claims- 2:12 Potential Harms- 5:07 Final Thoughts- 5:27 Bloopers- 6:18 I know many of you want to lose weight and there are tons of videos on weight loss out there. But I want to give you an honest doctor's take on the keto diet, which is essentially a high fat low carb diet. Its claim to fame is that helps to burn body fat for energy, therefore helping you lose weight quickly. But is fast weight loss even healthy? + Is this the best weight loss diet? Anyway, I could go into more detail covering the smallest intricacies of the diet but I did not want to weigh down the video, both literally and figuratively. Please let me know if this is too little, too much, or just the right amount of information about intermittent fasting. Also, I want you to remember that diets are not all about weight loss but more importantly about eating healthy. So let's get started with the Keto diet explained / Ketogenic diet explained diet review! I sincerely hope you enjoy, and definitely let me know if you want more videos like this by giving it a like and a share.

Funny story about this show. For some reason, the YouTube algorithm labeled your comments recommending Code Black as spam. So when I went into my comments review section I saw hundreds of comments pushing to make a code black reaction video. This is not as popular of a hospital drama show in ratings compared to monsters like House or Grey's anatomy but it still has a large fanbase and does well on CBS. After watching the show I was pleasantly surprised at not only how accurate code black is but also how much I enjoyed it. It really felt as if a doctor wrote the script and then it was fluffed up instead of the other way around. If you like this show please let me know in the comments so that I can watch and react to more episodes (suggestions welcome). Anyway, I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches Code Black / Real Doctor Reacts to Code Black.

I don't know about you but I know I want to live as long as possible. Growing up I always had the misconception that living longer meant things like taking your vitamins and having a 6 pack. I thought this because of the amount of misinformation given to us by marketers and IKA experts (https://youtu.be/gLDQr9i7LkM). Being healthy is a lifestyle choice. I talk to my patients, friends, and family every day about how to live longer and I wanted to talk to you guys about it as well. That's why I was so excited to see that this Harvard study came out and did a great job breaking down how lifestyle habits played into life extension. (links below). Now it's important to note that these 5 healthy lifestyle habits are not the only habits that extend life nor are they proven to be the ones that extend life to the greatest capacity. These just happened to be the 5 habits Havard researchers selected to test. If I had my pick I would stick to my 5 pillars of health. Now I want to know what you guys think about living longer and anti aging. Is this something you're curious about as I am. Feel free to leave me your thoughts in the comments down below!

Scrubs. Ever since I started my medical training in 2007 all of my friends have been telling me that I MUST watch the TV show Scrubs but for some reason, I was always a little hesitant to start it. Maybe because I looked at medicine as a serious field, it didn't make sense to watch a comedy about it. Well, now I am taking your advice and watching the first episode ever of the medical drama. Although I think this show is less of a medical drama is more of a medical comedy or satire. I can see why many medical professionals enjoy this show because working many hours in the hospital system can leave you feeling frustrated at times. Now, as far as my opinion goes I have to be honest. This show is not as appealing to me as it is for most of my friends. I feel like they take easy shots at medicine and exaggerate a lot for the sake of humor (especially Zach Braff ) Not sure why, but the humor didn't land for me that often. I also think I would probably need to watch a few more episodes as the pilot is rarely the best one. Also, Zach Braff irritates me just a little a bit in his acting. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches Scrubs / Real Doctor Reacts to Scrubs.

I have not watched this show before but in reading your comments on the last few videos it seemed like this should be next up for the medical drama review series. Considering I was a resident doctor myself this time last year, I was really excited to react to this new tv drama. In your comments, many of you made it seem as this show would be more accurate than the last few I've done so I had my hopes set very very high on this hospital tv drama. Matt Czuchry does a great job of acting the part of an internal medicine resident but the writing leaves a little something to be desired (from the medical point of view at least). The main plotline of the show might have to develop a little more for me to fall in love with it. The medical accuracy is pretty good but again very very dramatic, which is not new to this type of series.

Being a family medicine physician I can very much empathize with the situation. The dedication and contribution to healthcare from both fields is incredibly understated. Studying to become a nurse is a noble undertaking and it is a career with so many positives that I decided to make a dedicated video to all the amazing nurses out there. Instead of just me talking about nurses I decided to vlog with some of my staff I've been working with for the last few years to give you some first-hand insights into the career. Obviously, some of the nurses are a bit camera shy, which is understandable but I think they did a great job highlighting whats its like to be a nurse and in general about being a nurse. I know you guys have wanted a hospital vlog for some time now but as you can imagine vlogging in a hospital can be quite difficult with patient privacy and all. But for nurses week 2018 I had to make an exception and interview my colleagues. Also at the end of the video, you'll see many of the doctors I've worked or am still working with. So, on this kickoff for Nurses Awareness/Appreciation week I again from the bottom of my heart want to say: THANK YOU! - Doctor Mike Varshavski D.O. P.S.

I was really curious to see the difference in watching the show now that I am a licensed doctor. The last time I watched the program I was in high school and knew a tenth of the medical knowledge I know now! Honestly, I love this medical tv show series because I think it allows us to laugh at some of the crazy situations Hugh Laurie gets himself into. Plus It gave an interesting look at what life is like as an infectious disease doctor especially one as highly regarded as Dr. House. Obviously, the way that he practices medicine is not realistic or accurate because we don't break into people's homes nor do we treat them without explaining what we are doing. All in all, I think Dr. House is a must watch tv show if you're into medical dramas just for laughs alone.

You got it to 20,000 likes! You have spoken and I have listened. You should know that I do get the question a lot from patients as well. Is grey's anatomy accurate? So I finally decided to take a dive and find out! In this video, I sit down and watch the first ever Grey's Anatomy episode. Basically, a real doctor reacts to greys anatomy! I grew up watching ER and other TV medical dramas so I had a suspicion I would enjoy the show. I have to say this, greys anatomy is not medically accurate but the way it describes the characters as residents is very accurate. The hospital drama is real and I feel the show did a good job highlighting the difficulties of being a resident, inside the hospital and out. The one medical scene which totally threw me is when the surgeons automatically assumed that the seizure patient will need surgery before even coming to a diagnosis. That is not real life medicine. It surprised me that the show is actually very entertaining and I actually enjoy the drama between McDreamy / Derek Shepherd and Meredith Grey. Apparently, TV doctors do have souls haha. The hospital romance is real! Get this video to 15k likes If you want me to do another doctor reacts to greys or doctor reacts to the good doctor or any other show. Please comment down below the name of your favorite show and episode. Love you all and appreciate the support!

The prostate is a truly a misunderstood organ/gland. Not many people understand what the prostate does or what the prostate is. What makes the issue even more complex is what can go wrong with it. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) or enlarged prostate is a common condition that affects millions of lives. BPH treatments have several approaches that I discuss in this video. Prostate cancer is the number one cancer in men and not many people know the prostate cancer symptoms or the prostate cancer treatments. I'm sure many of you have heard of a prostate exam but not everyone knows the evidence behind it. The Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test is also very common but is not as good as you may think in extending or improving life. I hope you enjoy my breakdown of this complex but important topic!

I've seen over and over questions and comments regarding dieting so I decided to start a series where I conduct a diet review in detail. I know many of you want to lose weight and there are many videos on weight loss out there. But I want to give you an honest doctor's take on fasting or time restricted eating. I kicked off the series with the very popular, intermittent fasting or time-restricted eating. It's claim to fame is that helps burn belly fat/ lose your belly and it does so through fast weight loss. But is fast weight loss even healthy? Anyway, I could go into more detail covering the smallest intricacies of the diet but I did not want to weigh down the video, both literally and figuratively. Please let me know if this is too little, too much, or just the right amount of information about intermittent fasting.

First of all, I want to apologize for my congestion and nasally voice in this video. I was battling a mean cold and didn't want to miss this weeks video. I read your comments on the ""How I got into Med School"" video, and you all seemed to want to hear about the residency and social media journey as well. So here we go. In this weeks video, I wanted to have an intimate conversation about my path of getting into residency, my experiences in residency, as well as how my social media route began.Being a doctor and the residency match are both complex topics. This is a much longer video than usual, and I was debating if I should split it into two parts, but the stories seemed too intertwined to separate. I will make shorter videos in the future about social media and residency success.

I'm switching things up this week and giving you a simple breakdown of what hypertension or high blood pressure is all about. A very common question I get from my patients is, what is high blood pressure or what is hypertension and they are the same question! Doctors refer to hypertension as the silent killer and for a good reason! High blood pressure increases risks of many diseases and shortens your life significantly. I also discuss the new hypertension guidelines and how they impact your high blood pressure treatment. Many hypertension treatments are available and need to be discussed with your family medicine doctor. I also touch upon high blood pressure causes as there are natural ways to treat hypertension. High blood pressure is a complex topic with almost no symptoms and if there's anything I missed in the video, hit me in the comments section.
