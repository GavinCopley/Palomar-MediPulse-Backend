The shift in attitudes — almost 9 in 10 U.S. adults say alcohol use is “very” or “somewhat” harmful, according to a recent Gallup poll — follows research debunking the idea that drinking has any health benefit. The new trend: no- and low-alcohol drinks, known as the “NoLo” movement. NoLo, the fastest-growing part of the adult beverage market, is all about enjoying beverages and preserving their flavor without alcohol. NoLo drinks are becoming more popular among consumers, particularly millennials and Gen-Z, who want to reduce their alcohol intake, whether for health, social or personal reasons. For the sober curious or those simply looking to cut back, this episode explores the wide world of mocktails and NA drinks, and what mindful drinking actually looks like.
