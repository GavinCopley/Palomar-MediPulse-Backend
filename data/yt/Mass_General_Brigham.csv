Place the halved peppers in a large 9 by 13-inch baking dish, or on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over the peppers and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Use your hands to rub the oil all over both sides of the peppers, then arrange them with the cut sides facing up. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the peppers are a little blistered around the edges and easily pierced through by a fork. Set aside. Leave the oven on for baking the peppers. ¬∑ In the meantime, cook the rice: Bring a large pot of water to boil. Rinse the rice in a fine-mesh colander until the water runs clear. Add the rice to the boiling water and continue boiling, uncovered, for 30 minutes (reduce the heat as necessary to prevent overflow). Drain off the remaining cooking water and return the rice to the pot. Set aside. ¬∑ Prepare the filling: In a large skillet over medium heat, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil until shimmering. Add the onion and ¬Ω teaspoon of the salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook until they‚Äôre lightly squishy, another 5 minutes or so. ¬∑ Add the cilantro, garlic, chili powder and cumin. While stirring, cook until the garlic is fragrant, about 30 to 60 seconds. ¬∑ Remove the pot from the heat and add the rice, beans, lime juice and about 10 twists of black pepper. Stir to combine, then season with additional salt and black pepper, to taste. ¬∑ To stuff the peppers: first pour off any excess juice pooled within the peppers. Then stuff each pepper generously with the rice mixture (if the peppers were truly large, you should have just the right amount of filling‚Äîif you have extra, save it to serve as a side dish). Top the peppers with the cheese. ¬∑ Bake at 425 for 12 to 13 minutes, until the cheese is golden in spots. Serve warm with fresh cilantro leaves on top or any other garnishes of your choice.

The bacterium that causes cholera, called Vibrio cholerae, settles within the intestines after ingestion. There, it secretes a toxin that causes intestinal cells to secrete massive amounts of fluid, eventually leading to death from dehydration and shock if untreated. The disease is a significant problem in many impoverished regions of the world. Interestingly, immune responses to the toxin do not protect against cholera, but previous research led by investigator Edward Ryan, MD, director of Global Infectious Diseases at MGH, has shown antibodies that bind V. cholerae‚Äôs sugar coating‚Äîcalled O-specific polysaccharide (OSP)‚Äîdo offer protection. ‚ÄúA big question is: How do these antibodies protect? The answer would help develop better vaccines,‚Äù says Ryan, who is also a professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a professor of Immunology and Infectious Diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He notes current vaccines for cholera are not very protective in young children, who bear much of the global burden of cholera, and induce relatively short-term protection in recipients. To investigate, Ryan and his colleagues analyzed antibodies recovered from humans who survived cholera. Experiments showed the antibodies block V. cholerae bacteria‚Äôs motility. ‚ÄúV. cholerae are very mobile, and swimming is critical to their ability to cause disease,‚Äù Ryan explains. ‚ÄúInterestingly, the tail-like flagellum in V. cholerae that propels swimming is coated with the OSP sugar.‚Äù More detailed analyses demonstrated the human antibodies attached to this OSP coating to block the ability of V. cholerae to swim and cause disease. ‚ÄúOur results support a unique mechanism of protection against a human pathogen. We are not aware of previous work demonstrating a comparable direct anti-motility effect of human antibodies,‚Äù says Ryan. About the Massachusetts General Hospital Massachusetts General Hospital, founded in 1811, is the original and largest teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School.

Bob was assigned a team of doctors, who determined that he had a dyssynchrony and brought in Dr. Jag Singh, Dr. Kimberly Parks and Mary Orencole, NP, from the Resynchronization and Advanced Cardiac Therapeutics Program.

A Proto video series explores how hospitals, doctors and policy makers may be failing them. In Long Last Moments, Cathryn Delude details the events of her mother's slow death from Alzheimer's. She describes a health care system that seems calibrated to undermine her mother's wishes for comfort care. Delude ran into physicians who would not honor her mother's medical directives, a cap on hospice benefits that created a gap in her mother‚Äôs end-of-life care, and a maze of protocols that even she, as a long-time health writer, could not penetrate. The first video explores some of the institutional issues that face the increasing number of Americans who face a dementia diagnosis that may ultimately be their cause of death. ""What's it going to take for our society to be prepared for that tsunami of dementia which is coming?"" asks Diane Meier, director of the Center to Advance Palliative Care. Institutional Issues The second video explores how doctors and hospitals specifically need to find a new model of care for these patients. ""As we become more reliant on the technical aspects of care, we're having a harder time supporting the patient and family, and learning about them, and how we can best use the technology of medicine to reach their goals,"" says Julia Gallagher, medical director of the Home Based Palliative Care program at Massachusetts General Hospital. Changing doctor training protocols and re-imagining home as a center of treatment may help to narrow the gap.

AFib, the most common sustained heart arrhythmia, affecting nearly three million people in the United States, can lead to severe complications like strokes if untreated. Ed Cleary came to Massachusetts General Hospital in June 2012 to get his AFib treated. He had tried taking a blood thinner to help manage his AFib, but bled too much. Fortunately, he qualified for a new procedure now being used for the first time in New England by Mass General Hospital. The Lariat¬Æ procedure is for patients who cannot be on blood thinners. The procedure, which is minimally-invasive and uses catheters, ties off the left atrial appendage by use of sutures (blood clots often appear in the LAA and can cause strokes). In this video, Moussa Mansour, MD, director of the Mass General Atrial Fibrillation Program in the Institute for Heart, Vascular and Stroke Care, talks about what the procedure does, gives a general overview of the problem for some patients with the left atrial appendage and shares Mr. Cleary's prognosis.

General Patient First in New England to Receive Nerve Stimulator to Treat Heart Failure","Anita Levy, 59, arrived at Massachusetts General Hospital in 2012 with severe heart failure. The mother of four, grandmother of eight and wife of 38 years, was starting to lose hope. After trying a number of therapies without success, her doctors informed her she was a candidate for a new clinical trial. She's the first Mass. General patient and first person in New England to be enrolled and to have underwent surgery as part of INOVATE-HF, a randomized study testing the safety and efficacy of CardioFit¬Æ for the treatment of patients with heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction. CardioFit¬Æ is an implantable electrical stimulation device designed to restore balance in the autonomic nervous system and improve heart function in patients with heart failure. The device activates the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system for the treatment of heart failure by stimulating the vagus nerve on the right side of the neck. Vagal nerve therapy has principally been used to help treat patients with epilepsy and depression. This therapy is for patients who haven't responded well to traditional treatments and have severe heart failure symptoms. The trial is evaluating the device's ability to reduce hospitalization and death among heart failure patients. A 32-patient, multi-center, pilot clinical study was conducted in Europe, and data showed patients experienced significant improvement across clinical measures including left ventricular function and structure, heart rate variability and resisting heart rate. Patients also showed improvement in self-reported quality of life surveys and six-minute hall walk tests. ------------------------ In 2010, there were approximately 5.8 million people in the United States with the diagnosis of heart failure. Each year, approximately 670,000 people are diagnosed with heart failure, and more than 290,000 deaths are associated with the disease. It is more common in people over the age of 65, and it is the number one reason why people over the age of 65 are hospitalized. ------------------------ For more information about heart failure, visit: http://www.massgeneral.org/heartcenter/services/treatmentprograms.aspx?id=1006 For more information about the INOVATE-HF trial, visit: http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT01303718?term=INOVATE-HF&rank=1&show_locs=Y","heart,failure,INOVATE-HF,CardioFit,left,ventricular,dysfunction,Massachusetts,General,Hospital,Heart,Center,Dr.,Kimberly,Parks,Emad,Eskandar,Jagmeet,Singh,vagal,nerve,stimulator,cardiomyopathy",29,"Nonprofits & Activism",Health,PT5M39S,339,2d,hd,false,,,,,,,,1745,14,,0,0

Yeh, the study's corresponding author, along with co-authors in a multi-institutional research team, found that the use of drug-eluting stents after angioplasty bears little relationship to patients' predicted risk of restenosis (reblockage) of the treated coronary artery, the situation the devices are designed to prevent. The team reports the devices are used in treating more than 70 percent of patients with low risk of restenosis. Investigators in this study analyzed data from the National Cardiovascular Disease Registry (NCDR) of the American College of Cardiology to determine rates of drug-eluting stent usage among U.S. physicians, any association between stent use and patients' predicted risk of restenosis, and the potential impact of reducing usage among low-risk patients. Since patients receiving these stents need to take costly anticlotting medications for at least a year -- medicines that also have clinical risks -- the benefits of drug-eluting stents may not outweigh the risks, inconvenience and costs of the devices for those patients. In addition, the authors note, reducing unnecessary usage of drug-eluting stents could significantly cut U.S. health costs.

Over a half million new patients each year in the U.S. are diagnosed with heart failure, a condition in which the heart cannot pump enough oxygenated blood to meet the needs of the body's other organs. Many of these patients use CRT, the use of specialized pacemakers for treatment. CRT is well known to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure, but almost one-third of CRT patients continue to remain non-responsive to the treatment. Care is fairly fragmented for CRT patients with limited cross talk within subspecialties. In late 2005 / early 2006, MGH constructed a multidisciplinary clinic in an effort to bring subspecialties together. Multidisciplinary care in this study consisted of three visits to the MC clinic at Mass General over a six-month period. Patients received care from physicians, nurse practitioners, technologists and support staff with expertise in heart failure, EP/arrhythmia device management and ECHO, and had scheduled walk tests, quality of life assessments, device interrogations, assessments by electrophysiologists and heart failure physicians, and echocardiograms. The patients in the conventional care group were seen as needed by each subspecialist in the EP device clinic in separate visits at varying intervals. Echocardiogram-guided optimizations were dictated by physician discretion and not performed routinely. The big finding in this study was there was a 38 percent relative risk reduction for heart failure hospitalizations, transplant and/or mortality over a 2-year follow-up in the multidisciplinary group versus patients who received conventional care.

The new research underscores the value of using genetic approaches to test biological hypotheses about human disease prior to developing specific drugs. A team led by researchers from the Broad Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) explored naturally occurring genetic variations in humans to test the connection between HDL levels and heart attack. By studying the genes of roughly 170,000 individuals, the team discovered that, when examined together, the 15 HDL-raising variants they tested do not reduce the risk of heart attack.

Participation in marathon and half-marathon races, the study finds, is at an all-time high, but numerous reports of race-related cardiac arrests have called the safety of this activity into question. This study finds that participating in these races actually is associated with a relatively low risk of cardiac arrest, compared to other forms of athletics. An analysis of 10 years of data, appearing in the January 12 New England Journal of Medicine, reveals that most of those experiencing cardiac arrest during marathons and half-marathons had undiagnosed, pre-existing cardiac abnormalities. Male marathon participants accounted for most cardiac arrests and appear to be at increasing risk.

This strategy has proven effective for treating patients with various cancers, including those with advanced lung cancer and melanoma.

In their report in the October 28 New England Journal of Medicine, a multi-institutional research team reports that daily doses of the investigational drug crizotinib shrank the tumors of more than half of a group patients whose tumors were driven by alterations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. In another one-third of study participants, crizotinib treatment suppressed tumor growth.
