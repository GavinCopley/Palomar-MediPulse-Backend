It disproportionately impacts individuals in under-resourced communities. The good news? There’s a vaccine that can protect you from the most common cause of cervical cancer: infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). However, regular screening with a Pap test (also called a Pap smear) remains crucial. Screenings can help detect HPV infections, inflammation, or early signs of cervical cancer. Your age helps determine the best screening plan for you. According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI): - Women aged 21-29: It is recommended to get your first Pap test at age 21 followed by Pap testing every three years. - Women aged 30-65: Choose one of the following screening options: - An HPV test every five years - A combined HPV/Pap test every five years - A Pap test every three years Women over 65: Speak with your doctor to determine if you still need regular screenings. This depends on factors such as your health history. Don’t wait—schedule your screening today! Call (833) 632-2623.

This season, try the following tips to help combat jet lag: - Limit alcohol and caffeine before and during your travel - Pack a travel sleep kit with an eye mask, earplugs, and comfy clothes. - Drink plenty of water throughout your journey - Adjust your sleep schedule before your trip: Go to bed 1-2 hours earlier if traveling east, or 1-2 hours later if heading west.

Toys and creative play help children develop essential cognitive, social, and motor skills, along with self-confidence. But what makes a toy safe? - Look for the instructions and safety information. Phrases like “nontoxic,” “BPA-free,” and, on electric toys, “UL Approved,” help ensure you’re buying safe toys. - Beware of choking hazards: Younger kids — especially those under 3 — instinctively put things in their mouths. - Use helmets or protective gear when recommended - It’s important to clean toys regularly, especially when cold, flu, RSV, and COVID-19 are circulating. These simple steps can make playtime both fun and safe!

She was a picture of good health in 2013 when she noticed a small bump on her leg that her dermatologist removed and sent out for routine testing. The results were shocking – metastatic malignant melanoma. Dr. Dan Costin, her oncologist at White Plains Hospital, promised her she would live to realize her dream of attending the New York Yankees Fantasy Baseball camp that winter. She underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery at White Plains Hospital to remove three malignant tumors in her lung, and a few days later was back on her feet and ready to play ball. She continued seeing Dr. Costin, receiving a round of immunotherapy treatments to ensure the cancer had been eliminated. After a year of seemingly great results, it was discovered that the cancer had recurred, this time to her brain. That’s when Dr. Costin brought together an all-star team from both White Plains Hospital and Montefiore Health System, with the help of Dr. Steven Libutti, Director of Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care and a member of the White Plains Hospital Cancer Executive Committee. Dr. Costin quickly picked up the phone to call Dr. Patrick LaSala, a renowned neurosurgeon at Montefiore. Dr. LaSala removed the mass and prescribed a follow-up treatment of stereotactic radiation surgery (SRS), an innovative treatment combination that, along with additional immunotherapy, eliminated the tumor completely. The SRS treatment was performed by Dr. Madhur Garg, Clinical Director of Radiation Oncology and Co-Director of the SRS program at Montefiore. The new White Plains Hospital and Montefiore Health System partnership ensured that Louanne received exceptional, all-star care, close to home, and today, she remains cancer-free. She made it to the Yankees Fantasy Camp – her ultimate dream – and is looking forward to another winning season.

She recalls trying to shut off the treadmill, but when she awoke on the ground, it was still running. Thinking she had a concussion she went to the ER at a local Greenwich hospital where she learned she had had a stroke. The subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured aneurysm in her brain was beyond what her local hospital could care for, so a family friend and plastic surgeon recommended she see vascular neurosurgeon, Dr. David Gordon, a specialist at Montefiore dually trained in open and minimally invasive surgery. Once at Montefiore, Dr. Gordon performed an endovascular coiling procedure on Samantha. A guiding catheter was inserted into the femoral artery in her leg, and a microcatheter was then inserted through the guiding catheter into Samantha's ruptured aneurysm. Coils were then inserted through the microcatheter to close off the aneurysm and prevent it from further bleeding. Because she chose to go to the one hospital in the region that can treat very complex neurovascular cases, Samantha was able to avoid the high risk associated with undergoing open surgery to treat an aneurysm located near the brain stem. Thanks to the amazing teamwork of the Departments of Neurological Surgery and Radiology, the treatment was a success. Samantha is now back to the life she loves to live, managing a busy household, taking walks in her neighborhood, spending precious time with her kids--and taking nothing for granted. Montefiore is comprised of the highest caliber neurosurgeons and neuroradiologists.

She recalls trying to shut off the treadmill, but when she awoke on the ground, it was still running. Thinking she had a concussion she went to the ER at a local Greenwich hospital where she learned she had had a stroke. The subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured aneurysm in her brain was beyond what her local hospital could care for, so a family friend and plastic surgeon recommended she see vascular neurosurgeon, Dr. David Gordon, a specialist at Montefiore dually trained in open and minimally invasive surgery. Once at Montefiore, Dr. Gordon performed an endovascular coiling procedure on Samantha. A guiding catheter was inserted into the femoral artery in her leg, and a microcatheter was then inserted through the guiding catheter into Samantha's ruptured aneurysm. Coils were then inserted through the microcatheter to close off the aneurysm and prevent it from further bleeding. Because she chose to go to the one hospital in the region that can treat very complex neurovascular cases, Samantha was able to avoid the high risk associated with undergoing open surgery to treat an aneurysm located near the brain stem. Thanks to the amazing teamwork of the Departments of Neurological Surgery and Radiology, the treatment was a success. Samantha is now back to the life she loves to live, managing a busy household, taking walks in her neighborhood, spending precious time with her kids--and taking nothing for granted.","Montefiore Medical Center (Hospital),Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (Medical Treatment),Neurosurgery (Medical Specialty),hospital,NYC",27,Education,Health,PT16S,16,2d,hd,false,,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BQXZH_0QC4w/maxresdefault.jpg,,,,,2862,4,,0,0

But the severe arthritis in his hip was causing so much pain that Ed's active lifestyle was becoming almost impossible to maintain. Ed saw multiple surgeons in Manhattan and was told he was too old for joint replacement surgery. He was turned away. But Dr. Neil J. Cobelli of Montefiore's Adult Reconstructive/Joint Replacement Surgery department reviewed Ed's case, saw his special determination, and knew he was an excellent candidate for successful hip replacement surgery. Dr. Cobelli performed Ed's surgery, which was followed up by a rigorous course of post-op physical therapy designed by the orthopaedic experts at Montefiore. Today Ed is thrilled with his new total hip replacement. He is back to his normal active life—including long walks with his wife of 65 years. Ed is one more example of why The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP®) recognizes Montefiore as achieving exemplary surgical patient care and outcome.

But neither could she imagine that her condition would become life-threatening. After years of fighting the good fight, Daphne eventually had to deal with foot ulcers that did not heal, frequent hospital stays due to dangerously low blood sugar, and then renal failure that bound her to kidney dialysis for two years. At that point, Daphne, a 50-year-old Bronx native, became a candidate for a complex pancreas-kidney transplantation, a procedure reserved for the sickest diabetic patients with renal failure. In the United States, fewer than 1,300 pancreas or pancreas-kidney transplants are done annually, with surgeons most often needing to perform simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation in diabetic patients with renal failure, like Daphne. If successful, a pancreas transplant can effectively cure type 1 diabetes by restoring the body's ability to control blood sugar. The team at the Montefiore Einstein Center for Transplantation tapped into an impressive roster of internationally renowned surgeons and multidisciplinary experts to devise the best course of action and complete the procedure. Our surgical team implanted a donated kidney and pancreas during a challenging eight-hour surgery. Daphne now has independence from both dialysis and daily insulin. ""I think the transplant team is fabulous,"" she says. ""I love them all."" Lately, however, she spends less time with them, and more with her husband, children, family and friends.

But the severe arthritis in his hip was causing so much pain that Ed's active lifestyle was becoming almost impossible to maintain. Ed saw multiple surgeons in Manhattan and was told he was too old for joint replacement surgery. He was turned away. But Dr. Neil J. Cobelli of Montefiore's Adult Reconstructive/Joint Replacement Surgery department reviewed Ed's case, saw his special determination, and knew he was an excellent candidate for successful hip replacement surgery. Dr. Cobelli performed Ed's surgery, which was followed up by a rigorous course of post-op physical therapy designed by the orthopaedic experts at Montefiore. Today Ed is thrilled with his new total hip replacement. He is back to his normal active life—including long walks with his wife of 65 years. Ed is one more example of why The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP®) recognizes Montefiore as achieving exemplary surgical patient care and outcome.

At the end of June, the five murals created were installed in the waiting areas of five of Montefiore's health centers, enhancing the space for thousands of community members each year. This video follows the creation of a mural at THE POINT Community Development Corporation in the Hunts Point neighborhood of the South Bronx. The youth participants were part of THE POINT's M.I.S.T.E.R (Men In Society Today Examining Reality) young men's empowerment group. Four Montefiore Medical Group sites participated in this project: Comprehensive Health Care Center (CHCC), Family Health Center (FHC), West Farms Family Practice, and Williamsbridge Family Practice. The fifth site is the new Center for Child Health and Resiliency at the South Bronx Center for Children and Families. The five afterschool program partners were: Lehman High School, Morrisania Revitalization Corporation, Mosholu Montefiore Community Center, THE POINT Community Development Corporation, and Unity Neighborhood Center.

Safyer Discusses Childhood Obesity and Diabetes","Steven M. Safyer, MD, President and CEO of Montefiore Medical Center, joined Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Linda I. Gibbs and Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas A. Farley today to announce that obesity, which kills thousands New Yorkers per year, is one of the leading causes of preventable death in the United States, second only to smoking. Additionally, driven by obesity, one in three adult New Yorkers now has diabetes or pre-diabetes. Obesity also increases the risk of some cancers, heart disease, arthritis, and depression. With the majority (58 percent) of New Yorkers now overweight or obese, obesity is the only major public health crisis in America that is getting worse. In addition to the toll on health, the costs to the public are steep: in New York City $4 billion is spent annually on health care costs related to obesity. Montefiore is expanding access to healthy foods and running community fitness programs, including Zumba classes offered to its 18,000 associates and to community members, a partnership with the NYC Green Cart vendors who sell fruits and vegetables at strategic locations and hold cooking demonstrations with these foods in our clinics. Montefiore works with community after-school programs to run B'N Fit, a comprehensive weight loss program for obese teens, including medical, nutritional and psychosocial evaluations, treatment, programming and a six-week summer camp. Montefiore School Health is the largest school-based health center network in the U.S. Comprised of 19 public school-based health centers in the Bronx, the program reaches 20,000 children regardless of ability to pay and uses evidence-based prevention activities. Obesity is a rapidly growing and major public health problem. In the early 1960s it affected only 13 percent of Americans; by 2009-2010, 35.7 percent were obese. With 58 percent of New York City adults -- 3,437,000 people -- now overweight or obese, this has become the norm in our city. It is not a norm without consequences: obesity is a leading cause of preventable death, second only to tobacco, and kills 5,800 New York City residents per year. The obesity epidemic has led to massive increases in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, which can result in blindness, hypertension, and amputations. One in three adult New Yorkers now either has diabetes or a condition known as pre-diabetes, a condition where blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be considered diabetes and the person is at risk for developing diabetes in the future. In NYC it is estimated that there are 2,600 annual hospitalizations for amputations related to diabetes and 1,400 new dialysis patients due to diabetes each year. In addition, applying national estimates to the NYC population, over 100,000 adults 45 years and older have diabetic retinopathy (eye disease) which if untreated, may lead to blindness. Obesity also increases the risk of some cancers, heart disease, arthritis, severe obesity leads to immobility and depression. Obesity statistics are even more startling among NYC's youth. Despite recent progress with childhood obesity, 21.3 percent of NYC children ages 6-11 years are obese compared to 19. 6 percent nationally.","montefiore,obesity,diabetes,Steven Safyer,Mayor Bloomberg,NYC,soda ban,Health",25,"News & Politics","Health,Society",PT2M26S,146,2d,hd,false,,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UH4_BVVYa0Y/maxresdefault.jpg,,,,,1041,5,,0,0

The Mayor's Task Force on Obesity has proposed initiatives -- including limiting the size of sugary drinks, significant contributors to the epidemic -- with the goal of reducing the percent of obese adults by 10 percent and children by 15 percent over the next five years.

""In New York City nearly 60 percent of adults and nearly 40% of children are overweight or obese and there are real world consequences,"" said Mayor Bloomberg. ""People's lives will be shorter, their quality of life is going to be dramatically reduced and obesity is going to start killing more people in this country than smoking. Obesity is the only major public health issue we have that is getting worse and New York City has the courage to stand up and do something about it."" ""We applaud Mayor Bloomberg's courageous efforts to help fight obesity,"" said Dr. Safyer. ""I've watched for years as sugary beverages and unhealthy foods have been marketed to our children, while the obesity epidemic exploded. What we need now are far-reaching measures to protect our children from the risks of diabetes, heart disease, and cancers associated with obesity.""

While sharing many of the same characteristics as Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) and High-Functioning Autism (HFA), AS has been recognized as a distinct medical diagnosis in Europe for almost 60 years, but has only been included in the U.S. medical diagnostic manual since 1994 (""Asperger's Disorder"" in the DSM-IV). Individuals with AS and related disorders exhibit serious deficiencies in social and communication skills. Their IQs are typically in the normal to very superior range. They are usually educated in the mainstream, but most require special education services. Because of their naivete, those with AS are often viewed by their peers as ""odd"" and are frequently a target for bullying and teasing. They desire to fit in socially and have friends, but have a great deal of difficulty making effective social connections. Many of them are at risk for developing mood disorders (anxiety, depression), especially in adolescence. Diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders should be made by a medical expert to rule out other possible diagnoses and to discuss interventions.

YOU MUST BE WATCHING AT ALL TIMES! Rules of the pool: -Adults must watch their own kids or use a ""tag-system"" and designate one parent to watch at all times. -Kids should use a Buddy system -- pair up with one other child and help and watch out for each other. -Keep a phone by the pool -- NEVER leave the pool to answer the phone; keep emergency numbers next to a poolside phone. -Fence Your Pool -- make sure your kids and your neighbor's kids cannot get in without an adult. -Use power safety cover -- this is a mechanically operated cover, NOT a soft solar sheet. -Wear a life jacket -- but do not rely on this or other flotation devices to support your kid. -If a child is missing, look in the pool first! Also use lights in the bottom of the pool. -Choose a bright swim suit so you can see your child under water. -Learn CPR. Other water hazards to be aware of: -Bathtub: Don't rely on bath seats. Never leave a baby alone in tub, no matter what, not even for a few seconds. -Buckets -- inside & outdoors -- empty them before you walk away, a small child can drown in just an inch of water. -Toilet lid -- latch it! -Dog dish -- again, beware: a small child can drown in just one inch of water. -Ponds, lakes, rivers, ocean: Talk to older children about risk-taking behaviors around the water. Choking Prevention: A small child's airway is as narrow as a straw -- so keep that in mind when serving food: -Cut hotdogs lengthwise into quarters and then dice. -Avoid spoons of peanut butter -- they are like glue against the airway. -Monitor popcorn consumption. -Avoid round candy -- this can completely block the airway. -Soften & cut carrots -Avoid nuts -- these can cause allergic reaction or get lodged in airway. -Cut grapes in half or even quarters. Tips for safer eating: Mom was right! Mind your manners: -Eat slowly -Sit down -Don't talk & laugh with food in your mouth. -Hot dogs are especially dangerous because of their shape and because kids run around while eating them. -It's not just food that's a choking danger: -Any toy that fits through the hole of a toilet paper roll is too small for a young child. -Beware of antique toys, or even slightly out of date toys from older kids or at grandparents' houses -- they may not meet current consumer product safety commission standards. -Monitor older kids playing with younger children. -Latex balloons are a huge hazard -- they will block the airway and are nearly impossible to get out. Never give a small child a balloon. -Beware of strangulation hazards like pacifiers on strings and window cord blinds.","drowning,choking,childcare,montefiore,montefiore medical center,montefioremedicalcenter",27,Education,"Health,Television_program",PT12M11S,731,2d,sd,false,,,,,,,,2095,7,,0,0
