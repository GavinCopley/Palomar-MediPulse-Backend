Even if we do our best to avoid sun exposure and minimize stress, there’s no controlling gravity—over time, everyone’s skin will lose some elasticity and give way to wrinkles and sagging, especially on the face. Moreover, we tend to lose facial fat as we get older, so the skin not only drops but also deflates. Fortunately, you can address some effects of visibly aging skin without conventional facelift surgery. In this video, San Diego Health host Susan Taylor talks about the “mini facelift” option with Salvatore Pacella, MD, a plastic surgeon with Scripps Clinic and division head of plastic and reconstructive surgery.

The study gave 10,273 patients a genetic test, which uses a tumor sample to measure the presence of certain genes associated with higher likelihood of recurrence. Women are given scores based on this test, classifying them as being either at high risk of recurrence, intermediate risk, or low risk. About 17 percent of women had high-risk scores and were advised to have chemo. The 16 percent with low-risk scores now know they can skip chemo, based on earlier results from this study. The new results are on the 67 percent of women at intermediate risk. All had surgery and hormone therapy, and half also got chemo. After nine years, 94 percent of both groups were still alive, and about 84 percent were alive without signs of cancer, so adding chemo made no difference.","health,scripps health,scripps,san diego,california,healthcare,health care,doctor,breast cancer,chemotherapy,chemotherapy for breast cancer,breast cancer treatments,la jolla,scripps green,radiation oncology,oncology,breast cancer study,new breast cancer study,kusi news",29,"Nonprofits & Activism","Health,Society",PT5M21S,321,2d,hd,false,en,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AEw77cS82_k/maxresdefault.jpg,,,,,590,4,,0,0
