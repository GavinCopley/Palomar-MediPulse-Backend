Conversations About Autism is a series of 60-minute live-streamed sessions created for providers and caregivers of children with autism who wish to better understand the autism spectrum disorder. In this session we will be taking with clinical psychologist of the University of Washington and Seattle Children’s Autism Center, Jen Gerdts, and we will be joined by a parent of autistic boy and her son as well as an autistic self-advocate. If you have struggled in having the conversation with your child about their autism, I hope you can join us and be a part of the conversation.",,24,Entertainment,"Health,Society",PT1H2M24S,144,2d,hd,false,,en,,,,,,1627,19,,0,0

However, ABA is frequently misunderstood. Perceptions of ABA have recently been a ""hot button"" issue, due to reports that this intervention can lead to trauma. In addition, ABA advocates and members of the neurodiversity movement have sometimes been at odds, the former advocating for intensive treatment and the latter arguing that autism must be accepted as a form of diversity. This mixed information can be confusing for parents who are striving to choose the best therapeutic interventions for their child with ASD. This presentation will explore these perceptions of ABA and provide clarification of the scientific evidence for various claims, with the goal of helping parents navigate the confusion and controversy and confidently identify the best therapeutic intervention for their child and family.

However, there is plenty of evidence of the toxic treatment she withstood. Today, her lung capacity is 70%, she wears hearing aids and her beautiful curly hair has remained thin since her treatment.

ABA is the use of the principles and methods derived from research to bring about meaningful changes in socially important behaviors. ABA has demonstrated effectiveness across a variety of individuals, behaviors and settings.

Building Hope adds 330,000 square feet and 80 new beds to meet the demand for more space to treat the region's sickest children. Each room in Building Hope is private, reducing the risk of infection and promoting healing and peace for patients and their families. Larger patient rooms allow families to be with their child every step of the way.The rooms feature many patient-centered amenities, such as adjustable temperature and colored lighting, personal refrigerators, and ""Get Well Town,"" an interactive, Internet-equipped TV entertainment system with access to movies, games, and personalized care information. Each inpatient unit also includes a quiet room and family lounge so families can recharge and reconnect with the outside world. Building Hope includes the country's first inpatient cancer unit dedicated to teens and young adults. The new Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) cancer unit includes 16 inpatient beds for teens and young adults. The AYA unit provides a much-needed medical home for this age group, with targeted psychosocial support and an age-appropriate environment where patients can connect with their peers. Other unique features of the unit include a therapy gym, patient lounge, rooftop terrace, and multi-disciplinary care teams that include a dedicated psychologist and child life specialist. In addition to the critical care and cancer inpatient units, Building Hope includes an expanded emergency department (ED), which will open on April 23. The new ED has 38 exam rooms -- 17 more than the existing ED -- and a new model of care that allows families to be seen by a nurse right away. This innovative approach to emergency care means patients will have shorter wait times and shorter ED stays overall.
