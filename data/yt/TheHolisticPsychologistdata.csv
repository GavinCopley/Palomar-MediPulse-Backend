In World War II pregnant women were exposed to a devastating famine that killed tens of thousands of people. The results were shocking The children they gave birth to had higher rates of metabolic disorders cardiovascular disease and even mental health issues even though they weren't directly exposed to the famine. Here's what's incredible. The results didn't stop there .The grandchildren of those women even though they weren't exposed to the famine at all also showed a higher risk for similar health issues.What does this mean It's epigenetics at work How environmental factors like famine trauma and even stress can leave a mark on our genes altering the way our genes are expressed while not changing the genetic code at all. And it's those epigenetic changes that are passed down from generation to generation. This study flips what we thought we knew about genetics It shows that our experiences our stress and even the things that our parents and grandparents went through can literally reshape our biology and influence future generations. And most importantly epigenetics shows us that we can change our family story and actually heal oursel through our own choices. We can change our genetic expression. Research backs this because in a follow-up study researchers found that the epigenetic changes of people who were in the famine weren't permanent. People who had better nutrition and healthier relationships actually showed a reversal in effects and had overall improved. #epigenetic #genetics #stress #healthylifestyle #healthyliving","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,Health,PT1M36S,96,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A0a0vHAo3oA/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,29931,2300,,0,77

Therapist: What if I told you that you want them back so badly, not because who they are but just because you just want them to want you. You have abandonment wounds from childhood, and that just means that you're fixated on being chosen. We never learn what healthy love looks like. You're just not sure. So whenever you're with someone no matter how bad they treat you, or how checked out they are, you just want to keep the attachment. Beceause being left, is your greatest fear. Person: I know. I did everything to make it work. Therapist: Did you do everything to make it work? Or did you abandon yourself in order to not be abandoned by someone else. See that's what happens when we have these childhood abandonment wounds. We think that making it work means losing ourself in the process. Therpist: It's true and because you're anxiously attached you end up with partners who ara avoidant. And those partners don't want to to learn what your needs are. Or how to make you feel safe. Instead it becomes you doing all of the work. And over time you end up being resentful because you took emotional breadcrumbs.. Person: That's exactly why we broken up. Therapist: Your core belief is that you're not worthy of being loved, which leads you to avoidant partners who haven't healed enough to understand how to be in a functional healthy relationship. In the end you're exhausted and left feeling abandoned again, confirming your own core beliefs. #attachmentstyles #anxiousattachment #anxietyhealing #relationships #selfimprovement","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,Health,PT1M4S,64,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nOJO50D_J9c/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,59638,4126,,0,126

Studies show that conditions like depression, anxiety, and even bipolar are linked to how your brain processes energy, especially glucose. Your brain is the most energy-hungry organ in your body. And if it's not getting fueled properly, things start to break down. For example research shows that people who have depression, often have low glucose metabolism in key areas of their brain. This means that their brain isn't efficiently able to turn fuel into energy, leading to fatigue, brain fog, and mood instability. It's not just depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have been linked to insulin resistance. Meaning that their body struggles to regulate blood sugar, which directly affects brain function so instead of looking at mental illness as a chemical imbalance, we need to be asking how is the brain getting its energy? Is blood sugar stable or is it constantly spiking and crashing? Is insulin resistance playing a role? Because when you fix your metabolic health, you don't just change your physical health you change your mental health too. #glucosecontrol #mindandbody #bodymind #mentalhealth #nervoussystem","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,Health,PT1M3S,63,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W1h2b3WIRB8/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,66040,4306,,0,194

Complete transcript: The Holistic Psychologist: In a study called the placebo alcohol experiment, participants were given non-alcoholic beverages but were told they contained alcohol. And you know what happened? They acted intoxicated anyway. Their speech was slurred their motor skills were impaired. And they acted in a more social way. It was as if their brain convinced their body, that they were drunk. And their body followed the script. So what does this mean? Your beliefs shape your reality more than you might realize. The mind-body connection is so strong, that we can actually shape what our body experiences through what we believe. What if you believe that you're breaking generational cycles, that you're capable and resilient, that your body wants to heal, and you're in the process of healing. Your body is going to respond to those beliefs. So take out a piece of paper or the notepad on your phone and write down what you want to believe. And start practicing those beliefs everyday until they become a part of your reality. #alcohol #selfawareness #healingjourney #behavior #beliefsystem #mindbodyconnection","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT50S,50,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dcL8Rqz1IP8/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,33788,2678,,0,68

Person: Someone who truly loves me and who I feel connected with. The holistic psychologist: And when you get that relationship, what will you do? Person: At first, I'll be on cloud nine. I love, love. Then I'll get this voice in my head that says they're gonna leave me or betray me in some way. So I'll start to smother them and then accuse them of things. I hate that it. But I have trust issues. The holistic psychologist: at least you're honest Person: Then they'll start to pull away because I'm accusing them of things and needing constant reassurance. And I'll see that as proof that they never loved me in the first place. The holistic psychologist: Exhausting Person: Yeah, growing up my mother was emotionally unpredictable. Sometimes she was really sweet and loving and other times she was completely cold and shutdown. I never knew what version of her I was gonna get. It's scary to feel loved and the next minute to feel like someone just can't stand your existence. The holistic psychologist: So your mom's emotional instability created a situation where you feel like people will abandon you in the same way she did or blindside you like she did with her changes in mood. Person: Exactly The holistic psychologist: What's one of your biggest triggers in relationships? Person: Anytime I feel like someone's ignoring me or I feel mood changes. I panic because every time someone's mood changes growing up, something really bad or scary happens. Sometimes I create chaos or drama just so I get the attention that I crave. The holistic psychologist: And what do you wish people knew? Person: I don't want to be like this, I wish I could be easy going and relaxed relationships. I wish I didn't always assume the worst and have this urge to smother the people I love. I wish I could be like other people who seem to find relationships easy, instead of all consuming. #therapy #holistichealth #holistichealing #attachmentstyles #anxiousattachment","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,Health,PT1M22S,82,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1QeLLOWEl1o/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,72299,4897,,0,125

Your life is fully on you. No one is coming to save you, and no one is coming to rescue you. So if you want a better life you really do have to work for it. Now is it fair that you have to break the cycle of intergenerational trauma? No, it's not fair. It's not fair that some of us are children in adult bodies, and we have to teach ourselves how to be a healthy adult. It's not fair that some of us didn't have emotionally healthy role models. I get it because I'm in the same boat. But if you really want to heal you need to accept reality. And when you accept reality, you finally have the opportunity to change it. And you can change it by putting yourself to bed early, and by starting to care about the food that you put into your body. By becoming aware of what your attachment style is. By learning how to regulate your emotions. And by pushing yourself to go out into the sun and nature. Even when you want to stay under the covers. We're not gonna get better until we do better. There's no magic fix and no magic pill. And you have so much more influence over how your life goes than you're probably aware of right now. So start talking to yourself seriously. Start taking care of your body, and start getting outside and watch how your life changes.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,Health,PT1M6S,66,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hjImWL8U6dM/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,93602,8354,,0,216

It passes on his life experiences, his stress, his fears, and even his emotional patterns. Here's how it works. When your father created you, his sperm didn't just carry genetic material, it carried epigenetic markers that were shaped by his life. This means that every time he dealt with stress, faced trauma, or even lived through major life experiences, those moments didn't just affect him. They affected the sperm that created you. Let me put this into perspective. If your dad went through something like an emotional hardship, unhealthy relationships, or even had poor nutrition. Those experiences physically changed the way his genes were expressed. And those changes were passed down to you. So when you feel anxious, struggle with stress, or notice emotional patterns that just don't make sense. It's not just you, it could be the imprint of your father's nervous system and his emotional struggles, living on inside you. And the most mind blowing part, you can change it. You can rewrite the story of your nervous system, your emotions, and your reactions. #father #genetics #familydynamics #healing #healingjourney","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,Health,PT1M1S,61,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jbQVKnEoN4E/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,57462,3332,,0,177

Person: Someone who lets me do my own thing, who has their life and who loves me for who I am. The Holistic psychologist: And when you get that relationship, what will you do? Person: Self-isolate. Shutdown when they want to talk about issues, and in general accuse them of being difficult or high maintenance. The Holistic psychologist: honest one Person: They'll usually call me out on my behavior, which makes me self isolate even more. And then I'll get really really self loathing. I'll tell them I'm just not what they want anyway. And that they're better off without me. The Holistic psychologist: So you say those things to gain sympathy from them and hope they comfort you and get distracted from the deep issue. Person: Exactly. Growing up I never saw anyone work through their issues. We all lived in the same house like familiar strangers. There wasn't much affection or time spent together. I learned to do everything alone, being alone is where I feel the safest. It's my comfort, and anytime I'm stressed, I self isolate to feel the same safety. The Holistic psychologist: What's one of your biggest triggers in relationships? Person: Someone expecting me to meet their needs. I'm confused about my own emotions and needs and I easily shut down. So when someone expects me to meet their needs, I'm filled with shame I just want to hide. The Holistic psychologist: And what's something you wish people knew about you? Person: I don't want to be like this, I hate that I always have the urge to run away from my problems. I hate that when I'm with someone I love, I fantasize about being single again. Or I romanticize a past relationship, where I had the exact same problems. I wish I knew how to express my emotions.

And your brain developed based on the nervous system, you inherited. This is called epigenetics. Epigenetics tells us, that the experiences and the environment of one generation influences the next generation's genetic expression. Starting in the womb we absorb everything our mother experiences, so if she was anxious in a toxic marriage or if she was shutdown and depressed our nervous system mirrored hers. When our mother was chronically stressed cortisol can cross of the placenta barrier, and impact areas of the brain that are responsible for executive function, like the pre-frontal cortex. This is why so many of us struggle with executive dysfunction, have high anxiety, and can't regulate our emotions. This is also why so many us don't feel safe in our body, and why our brain is wired for constant worrying and thinking about the next crisis. It might feel like it's coming out of nowhere, but it's actually not. The positive thing about our brain and our nervous system, is that they're flexible. We can widen the window of tolerance of our nervous system and become better at regulating our emotions.

When you're walking, your eyes are naturally moving from side to side without you even thinking about it. This is known as bilateral eye movement. Bilateral eye movements quiet down the amygdala, which is known as the fear center of the brain. This is the basis for EMDR therapy, which uses bilateral movement to help process trauma. Florance Clark was a therapist who created walking with clients instead of sitting on a couch, she found walking to be the best movement to help clients process trauma. She noticed that clients with trauma not only could connect with the memory of the trauma better when walking but could also talk about it more freely. When we experience trauma or intense anxiety our left hemisphere which is associated with logical thinking. And our right hemisphere which processes our emotions, can disconnect and begin to work separately. Bilateral eye movements help the two hemispheres to synch up and to work more effectively and help the brain integrate the memory in a way that's less traumatic. Ultimately lowering our body stress response. So instead of talking about it, or overthinking it, walk through it. #selfawareness #traumahealing #traumarecovery #trauma #emotionalhealing","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,Health,PT1M4S,64,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QnLFvRpmVSM/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,78454,6429,,0,131

A grandmother is raised in a chaotic and unstable environment. This grandmother had to clean up the house take care of her siblings always scan the environment to notice if her dad was drinking or her mom was going to lay in bed for hours from a depressive episode. That grandmother has a daughter who overcorrects in a subconscious attempt to heal from her own childhood. Her daughter notices her mom is highly anxious smothering and overbearing. When she tries to get space from her mom , her mom says I wish I had a mother who actually cared. And the daughter pulls far and farther away from her. Her daughter copes with these conflicting emotions by becoming avoidant daughter grows up and has her own daughter. This daughter is a highly sensitive child she cries a lot she's emotionally needy and she wants physical touch and soothing to calm her nervous system. this triggers her mother because it reminds her of the helplessness she felt in her own childhood from her mom's overbearing nature. When her child cries or becomes needy for attention she punishes the child calls her too sensitive or ignores her completely. Over time the daughter learns that she's only loved when she's easy. And when she represses her emotions she becomes a people pleaser. The daughter ends up with men who require her to suppress her own emotions and needs and who need her to take care of them. She's comfortable in this role because it's the same role she experienced growing up with her mother. She stays with these men because a part of her feels like a burden that her sensitivity and her neediness is something to be ashamed of and to hide. She believes if she were to speak up around what she needs she'll be emotionally abandoned like she was in childhood and that's too painful for her to experience. #traumahealing #traumarecovery #trauma #authenticself #selfdiscovery","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,"Health,Knowledge",PT1M31S,91,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UYDw3AlKNdk/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,111243,6379,,0,214

So I can never fully relax. I actually reply our conversations all the time. And I wonder if I said something that offended you. I had to know the exact moment when my parent's mood would change, so I could go and hide in my room. So now I read the room like my life depends on it because at one time it did. Don't even talk about when my dad would punish me. Person 1: Well, no wonder you're hypervigilant. You learned that when someone got angry you'd be in physical danger. So you feel like you're still in trouble and on the verge of making someone mad at any moment. That's how our nervous system works, it interprets the present based on what happened to us in the past. Person 2: Yah, sometimes I sit at work, and I think I'll get fired when I haven't done anything wrong. Or like one of my friends hates me because of something I said the night before.

It just means I'm stressed from work. You don't need to decode it. Person 1: Oh, but I do. I grew up having to decode things, like when I got the silent treat from my mom. Or when my dad's mood would suddenly change and he had rage around the house. I never felt safe so I became hyper-vigilant. Person 2: Is that why you're always asking if I'm okay or If I'm mad at you? Person 1: That's called emotional monitoring. Person 2: Feels kind of controlling like you're smothering me in some way. Even when tell you I'm okay, you just keep asking. Person 1: I know, I expect you to regulate my nervous system. If you're not okay then I'm not okay. If you're stressed, then I'm stressed. I take on whatever emotion you have. I absorb it like a sponge. It's a form of codependency, where I not only feel everything you feel, but I also feel responsible for it too. Person 2: That sounds really stressful for you. Person 1: Oh it is. I'm on an emotional roller coaster all day. Worried your mood will change that your feelings for me will change. That maybe you're even hiding something from me. I overthink and make tons of assumptions too which create even more anxiety then I look more and more to you to calm and reassure me about the anxiety that you didn't even create. Person 2: That's really stressful for me and makes me want to pull away from you. Person 1: And you pulling away from me, makes me put pressure on you even more to treasure me. Person 2: And you pressuring me makes me check out more and (this is a cycle in relationships if you're anxiously attached) Person 1: And that just confirms my belief that everyone who loves me will leave me. #anxiousattachmentstyle #anxiousattachment #hypervigilance #attachmentstyles","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,Health,PT1M24S,84,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mwrW-3dfHOo/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,63688,4548,,0,137

You're gonna take a slow and deep breath in from your belly until you can't take in any more air. And while you're dong this you're gonna say to yourself ""I am safe."" Then on the exhale while you're breathing out you're gonna say to yourself ""my body is calm."" Do this 2-3 times and notice how your heart begins to slow down and your shoulders naturally relax.

Parent: It's really how I make conversation, I don't know how to talk about ideas or things of interest. Gossip is really my go-to topic. Child: And you know what that's teaching me? Well, because I think this is normal, I think everyone is like this. When I walk into a room I'm starting to think everyone is talking negatively about me (this is how social anxiety can develop). I see someone looking at me and think they're making fun of me or criticizing me for my weight. I'm developing a fear of being perceived. Do you know what that is? Parent: No Child: Okay, here's what I'm learning. Everyone is harsh and judgemental. You mention someone's appearance in almost every story you tell, even though it's not relevant to the story you're telling. So now I'm super focused on how I look. I already started a diet, but you probably didn't notice anyway. The fear of being perceived is getting worse and worse until I develop social anxiety by the time I'm in my 20s. The worst part, is that it will affect my relationship with you. Because I want to tell you everything about the people I'm dating. About all of my friends, but you'll never have anything positive to say. I'll regret coming to you in the first place. So I'll just shut down and when I do, you'll say things like ""How come you never tell us anything."" #judgement #home #perception #shutdown #socialanxiety","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT1M15S,75,2d,hd,true,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8S8djt8Ccj0/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,43599,4751,,0,161

Parent: I never thought of it like that. Child: I know so I'm helping you out, I'm learning to be hard on myself, and beat myself up because of how I'm perceived by you. I get it's stressful, but if you start to learn to regulate your emotions, I can too.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT49S,49,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DF8Ibqi5XW0/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,45161,4389,,0,85

It's just that I don't like our conversations anymore, and I feel like somethings missing. I'm numb there's just no romantic connection between us. And when you try to fill me in about your day I feel irritated. It takes too much of my energy. I keep having thoughts of I'm better off alone. Or maybe there's someone better out there. I have this fantasy about getting my freedom back. But, I don't tell you anything because that would require me to be vulnerable. And there's no way. I feel like you're really fragile and I don't want to tell you anything because it would probably create a fight or conflict and I have no idea how to deal with that. I'm mentally checked out of this relationship, but we still live together. Person 1:Wow, I really don't know what to say but I wish you told me this sooner. The avoidant: I feel like you can't deal with the truth, and I think I'm being a good person by staying with you. I almost feel like it's my duty. I'm being deceptive but I don't see it this way.

For example, you feel responsible for them getting and keeping a job. For them taking care of their own health or even fixing their relationships. You don't see people as responsible for their own behaviors and their outcomes in life. Because you take on this role, you're often exhausted, burnt out, or resentful. This is because you're actually not responsible for anyone else's life outcomes. And when we are over responsible for other people we're actually treating more like a child than an adult and this creates a lot of resentment. It also creates an unequal dynamic where we're giving so much and we're not receiving. So when you notice yourself feeling resentful or really angry in relationships I want you to ask yourself ""Am I taking more responsibility for someone who should be taking responsibility for themselves?"" And this answer is gonna give you a lot of insight into your relationships.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT52S,52,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z9iA8-k87pY/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,34870,3468,,0,67

When people have so much pressure, inside their body systems lots of fight-or-flight energy and racing thoughts without coping skills. They're like a pot that's ready to boil over. The person gets high because it's just too intense to feel and to deal with. So they take a sip of alcohol, they use that drug, they go on online shopping binges. And immediately their thoughts slow down. The uncomfortable sensations fight or flight go away. And in that moment they no longer feel their pain. So they get a dopamine hit in the process, but the motivation to use is to avoid their own pain. If you look at people who struggle with addiction they all have two core traits: 1 low frustration tolerance 2. Inability to cope with stress (inability to self soothe). Little mistakes make them feel irritable and overwhelmed and they don't know how to move through those emotions in healthy ways, which is why they end up being so self-destructive. And destructive to the people in their lives. Addiction is a misguided attempt to self soothe.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,Health,PT1M2S,62,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3d034tQRWT4/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,19715,2097,,0,68

So the next time you feel anxious I want you to go to your freezer, and get out an ice pack or a bag of frozen veggies whatever you have. And then you're going to put this on the back of your neck right where your vagus nerve runs. Hold it there 1-2 minutes, breathe slowly and deeply.

I need to do my own thing and focus on me. Person 2: Okay, what happened? Person 1: Nothing really I just started thinking I don't feel that attraction anymore and I was like if I don't see this relationship going anywhere, why am I investing my time into it? When I tried to take space, he was pushing me more and more to talk, so I knew I had to end it. Person 1: Okay, so sounds like of your past relationships, where things start off really good, but then your partner has some emotional needs and you get overwhelmed. Then all you think about it getting away and going back to your own life and being single. Person 2: Pretty much, I don't know why I push everyone away. I just can't be in a relationship or commit to people. Maybe I belong alone. Person 1: here's what's happening, whenever you're in a committed relationship, you feel vulnerable. Being vulnerable was never safe for you growing up, so it puts your nervous system in a flee response. Where you feel the only way that you can solve the problem is to run away and be alone. Person 2: Correct Person 1: Being alone and not having anyone need anything from you is the only time you feel safe. A hallmark trait of an avoidant attachment style, which is why right after you have a break up you feel relief. Person 2: At first I'm so numb, I feel nothing at all. I'm just so shut down and then I guilt myself for not having normal feelings after a breakup. But then later it hits me, that I lost someone that I really cared about again. And I feel bad because I really blindsided them. Then I get really depressed and super lonely and get back on the dating apps.

Here's why: all of us have a lens through we see things, and when we have an insecure attachment style, we have core beliefs that we're not good enough and that we'll always be abandoned or that people can't be trusted. Our brain is always looking to confirm the things that we believe to be true about ourselves. This is called confirmation bias. So let's say that your partner tells you that they're going to do something and they forget. If you have an insecure attachment style, you're not going to think maybe they got busy or something came up. You're immediately going to go personalize the other person's behavior. And subconsciously create a story that confirms one of your core beliefs. So you might tell yourself that your partner did this because they don't consider you or you're not important enough to them. When you project your core beliefs onto your partner over and over again, this will naturally push the other person away. Even if they try to explain to you why they did what they did, you won't believe them because your brain is already created a confirmation bias. If you have an insecure attachment style, the most important thing you can do when you're triggered is to pause and breathe. Your brain is going to watch to race to create a story to help you feel safe. But you're going ng to want to ask yourself, is this 100% true, or is story an assumption based on my past?

The good girls. The women who are taught to suppress their anger, to be easy, and to be agreeable. It makes sense that women are more likely to develop autoimmune disorders because we've been conditioned from a young age to be nice. We've heard this over and over again in our childhood, if we cried said we didn't wanna share or got angry, we were told to stop it and be nice. So what does that really mean? It means we don't ever show or release our anger. So what do we do? We suppress that anger, we keep that anger in our body and we never release it. What happens to our body when it's full of unprocessed anger? our body becomes inflamed, and what causes autoimmune disorders, chronic inflammation. Being a good girl is making us sick. It's not that our body is attacking itself, it's that our body is needing to release anger in healthy ways.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT54S,54,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F54O-JByFpg/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,34169,4120,,0,136

I didn't need security from a parent, but they were also the cause of my fear. This greatly impacted my ability to trust. Sometimes, that parent was kind and loving, and other times, they were scary and unpredictable. I never felt safe enough to fully be in my body, so I spent most of my time dissociating and daydreaming. I really crave being close to you, but I have an intense fear of rejection, so I subconsciously do things that will sabotage our relationship. I can be really passive aggressive when I'm triggered. It's like you have to pull things out of me, because I never learned healthy communication patterns. Any changes in your behavior send me into fight or flight. If you don't text me I feel like you're being distant. I can get irrationally anger or shut down. My brain registers these changes as threats. And I really struggle to soothe myself or to calm down. I'm ashamed of how I react a lot of the time.

The window of tolerance is how much stress or stimulation you can tolerate in your day to day life. Someone with a wide window of tolerance will spend the majority of their day in a regulated state. Where they feel calm and at ease, and they trust the world around them. They get dysregulated during stress or conflict, but they're also able to return back to that regulated state after their emotions pass. Someone with a small window of tolerance will regularly go into hyperarousal or hypo arousal. Hyper arousal is when you go into fight or flight and you have an angry irritable or an emotionally reactive response. Hypo arousal is when you're in freeze and you're numb, checked out or you have a monotone response. People with complex trauma are really just stuck in hyper arousal or hypo arousal throughout the entire day. And sometimes they go back and forth between the two, which can really look like what we call mood swings. A sign you might be stuck in hyper arousal or hypo arousal if you spend the majority of your time looking for something external to soothe you. It can be food, substances, social media, or really anything that helps us feel like we're in our window of tolerance, even though we're not. This is why it's so important for people with complex trauma to do something that's called widening the window. We actually have the power to expand our window of tolerance through intentional practices.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,Health,PT1M12S,72,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AOXU3LC0T4c/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,48465,5845,,0,100

Growing up my parents were able to put aside their own issues and emotions, to focus on my emotional needs, not all the time but a majority of the time. One parent didn't control the emotional tone of the home, so I don't ask if you're upset or okay all the time. When you're inconsistent I pull away. And I don't try to compete for your love. Actually seeing inconsistency is something that won't be healthy for me long term. I don't overanalyze everything you do. I've learned that healthy adults express what they need. If you expect me to read your mind, I know this is not a relationship for me to invest in. I'm not interested in fixing or caretaking you. I choose friends and partners based on who they are, not who I wish them to be. I expect that you can take care of yourself. I don't take everything personally.

Here’s how to cope The holistic psychologist: Have you ever been through a friendship breakup? It is very normal to change, outgrow, or end friendships. We live in a society that believes relationships only end when something bad happens. A lot of us feel shame when we end friendships or when people end friendships with us. Friendship breakups happen for a lot of reasons. So what are some of them? Your interests change, and you've grown apart. You might have had a friend that you connected with over sports, and now you have new interests. You might want to spend some time doing different things. Say you had a friend you spent time with drinking or overspending, and you just don't want to do that anymore. A friendship might end when you find that there's no room for you in the relationship. Say you have a friend who is always venting about their problems and never asks about you. Friendship breakups are not talked about very often, and they happen to all of us throughout life. It can be sad, we are grieving, the relationship with someone we've had in our life for a long time, and at the same time it can be hopeful because we're also making space for more authentic connections.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,Health,PT1M5S,65,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DnZffIvZ5bs/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,25279,2374,,0,95

Here's what to know The holistic psychologist: If you're anxious and your mood is all over the place, you might have a histamine intolerance. If you also have itchy skin, allergies, racing heart, brain fog, or panic attacks. Histamine levels play a huge role in our mood, how we respond to stress, and how anxious we feel. Our central nervous system has histamine receptors. And when there's too much histamine bound to those receptors, our mood can go haywire. Some of us struggle to break down histamine, so we end up being overloaded all of the time. You feel really anxious and are unable to control your emotions, and if you're having allergy-like symptoms, or other skin issues that aren't being caused by something externally. You might want to look into histamine intolerance and mass cell activation syndrome. Histamine intolerance is linked to every mental health disorder, so it's important to recognize this as a root cause because so many people are getting misdiagnosed.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,Health,PT50S,50,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8X8E3lZpYFw/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,69786,6791,,0,248

Here are 4 signs you were this daughter: 1. You have to be a good girl. You actually repress how you feel to make people comfortable. 2. You abandon your own needs. Your needs were never met or recognized, so you learn that they're not important. And you feel guilty and shameful for even having them. You might even feel like a burden and not know why. 3. You believe it's your responsibility to make sure no one is upset or disappointed, this is called emotional monitoring. You never learn that adults are capable of disappointment, and it's not your role in life to manage the feelings of other adults. 4. You suppress your anger and rage. You suppress all of those emotions, through food, scrolling on social media, drinking, or really anything else that helps you numb those uncomfortable feelings.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT50S,50,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JpxaFJRCRyk/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,87565,7862,,0,303

One or both of her parents were dysfunctional, and I learned that means no one will show up for me or love me the way that I deserve to be loved. Because I learned that I could not depend on people, I started to become hyper independent. Even though I want love and care more than anyone, I learned that I can't trust love, so I push it away. Sometimes I'm really controlling and a Type A, and this is actually my fear response. I don't want to be controlling, but I was never given the opportunity to sit back and just know that someone else can be relied on. My fantasy is that you can read my mind. That you'll know every part of me without me being vulnerable. Or without me having to tell you exactly what I need, because that that just proves your love for me. I love extremely hard and I'm incredibly sensitive, but that side of me is not something I'm comfortable showing you. So instead I say I'm fine when I'm not, or I completely shut down. The wall I have up is not something I want to have up. It's something I've had to have up since a young age to survive. Asking for help terrifies me, so does expressing my feelings. Because I was punished for them or they were invalidated growing up. So what I need more than anything, is your patience and reassurance.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,Health,PT1M6S,66,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HXAz-hG0aKg/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,51576,5901,,0,147

Let's break it down Holistic psychologist: Here's what someone who is avoidantly attached wants you to know. Growing up, I never had safety or attunement, instead, I was met with criticism or completely ignored. So withdrawing is my survival mechanism. My nervous system goes into a flea response, and I feel trapped often. And I think the solution to having intense emotions, is to run away from them. I'm hyper sensitive to criticism, and I view a conflict as a personal attack. I was never shown that people can grow closer together through healthy communication. I fear conflict so much I never speak up for myself. Until one day I become so overstimulated I shut you out. I blame you for this and struggle to see how it's my own fear of vulnerability. I feel smothered by your emotions and needs. No one showed me how to meet my needs, so meeting yours feels impossible. At one time being dependent on someone was terrifying. Being hyper-independent gives me the illusion that I'm safe. Ironically It only keeps us further apart. I spent most of my childhood alone in my room. Being alone with no one to perceive me or judge me, is the only place I feel like I can be myself. Sometimes when I'm with you, I feel like all of my flaws are on display.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT1M,60,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oeH-9pSfQO0/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,399903,31328,,0,676

Let’s Break It Down Holistic psychologist: here's what someone who is anxiously attached wants you to know. Growing up love was given to me and it was also taken away from me. And that was confusing, and made me feel like I had to walk on eggshells. One parent sent the entire mood of the home. So I had to notice every change in their mood or tone. And now I do that to you. I ask if everything okay, I ask if you're mad at me, I create meaning around every action you do, and that meaning is usually negative because I just can't trust you to show up for me. Sometimes I test you to make sure you can handle me. When I do this I think that I'm protecting myself, but really I'm sabotaging the relationship, and making it even harder to get the connection I need. If you need space or quiet, my nervous system goes into fight or flight. There was usually quiet before eruptions growing up. So I learned that space for quiet is not only a bad thing, It meant that I was in danger. I push you away but all I actually want is to be loved. I love extremely hard and I'm incredibly sensitive and sentimental. In my entire life, I've always felt that no one has reciprocated how much love I give.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT59S,59,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BJKt2e0ef7w/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,146006,15748,,0,326

Emotional support looks like being checked in on, or asked about your feelings, experiences, life, or about anything in general. Getting the idea that they really care or want to know how you feel. Once you do share how you're feeling, emotional support looks like acceptance. Not hearing our stop you're so dramatic, or you shouldn't feel that way. It looks like just listening and accepting, what it is that you feel. Emotional support also looks like feeling safe enough to express your wants, your needs, your desires, and not always worrying about your parent's overreaction or their abandonment or silent treatment, if they don't like what you have to say. Emotionally supportive parents validate your perspective, even when it's different from their own. They don't try to shame you out of thinking for believing what you believe. Emotionally supportive parents respect your boundaries. They don't spy or snoop or insert themselves into your relationships.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT1M4S,64,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HDW-kADNG8s/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,31743,4008,,0,138

Mom: exactly, your father has come from a generational belief, that all men need to do is go to work, and home home he's hands off, just like his own father was.

Child: even this Saturday, he let you know that he'll be gone all day to watch football at a friend's house. Which means you're pretty much responsible for me and my brothers all by yourself and he has the expectation that you won't bother him, and you do it all by yourself. Last time I checked you don't get full days to yourself where you're not bothered. Child: Okay, here's what I think, it's time for a change, mom's need help. They don't just want someone who provides, they need someone to step and be a true partner. Wouldn't it be nice if dad said next Saturday he would make you breakfast in bed? And he would take care of us? Or if he saw the kitchen and cleaned without being asked. Or if at the end of the day, he left you a note telling what great mother you are.

The people pleaser. You may be thinking well I'm not angry, and the answer is of course you are. Because somewhere along the way you learned that it wasn't safe to express yourself, to disagree or to upset someone. So you've pushed down all of your wants and all of your desires, anger is a sign that your needs are unmet. Or that your boundaries are being violated. And over time you build up more and more anger. Anger can eventually turn into resentment. Anger is stored in our back and our hips. And it can turn into headaches, stiffness and even chronic pain. So you need to create an outlet to help your body release it. That might mean screaming into a pillow, punching a pillow, or even writing an uncensored letter that you're not gonna send. You may even cry when you're doing this. And that's actually a sign that your anger is being released.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT46S,46,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v4P2_badzWU/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,155662,20333,,0,434

I'll give you an example: last minute her mom calls and asks her to come over for a family dinner. She already has plans so she said she can't come over. Her mom sounds disappointed and might say something like well we haven't seen her in a while or she might start talking about her age and how she won't be around forever. After she gets off the phone she's consumed with guilt and our nervous system goes into fight or flight. Even though she's had these plans for a while and her mom called last minute. She almost feels like she has to cancel her plans to please her mom. Or to avoid the guilt trip that she'll face for taking time for herself. This is really a theme for the parentified daughter. She believes it's her role to never upset or disappoint anyone. And she'll rearrange her life over and over again, to make sure she fulfills that role, even at the cost of her own well being.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT45S,45,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2wI115Xe2CM/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,48848,5107,,0,178

The holistic psychologist: Do you find partners you need to parent? The parentified daughter subconsciously looks for partners who are not fully responsible. She finds herself drawn to people that she has to parent. To people that over rely on her. Just like she was relied on in childhood. The role of being a caregiver is deeply ingrained in her. Over time she becomes exhausted and resentful. But, at the same time she can't leave this role because it's so familiar. Seh knows exactly how to operate in that type of relationship. And maybe most importantly, there's a part of her that doesn't actually believe that there's anyone out there who she can rely on or who's able to meet her needs.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,Lifestyle_(sociology),PT37S,37,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VROtehNpgLk/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,65108,5202,,0,181

They might have called you their best friend or even the rock of the family, so you need up taking on your parents emotional burdens. And feeling completely responsible for them. There's a part of you that senses that your parents need you. So all of your focus goes on them and making sure they're okay. And in time your emotional needs are being ignored and going unmet. Though you end up learning that being in a relationship, means that no one is gonna care for you. So as an adult, you feel really guilty for saying no, setting boundaries and needing your own time and space. It is also common for adults who've been parentified, to feel completely responsible for other people, especially when they're struggling. This is the continued role of caretaking. They may even choose a career path like being a nurse or a therapist. Where their focus is always on other people. This is why healing from parentification really involves becoming selfish. Or self focused for the first time in your entire life.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT1M,60,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IgblAOelxLg/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,104084,11726,,0,316

Person 1: Oh, not for me, I have doubts here and there. I just didn't tell you. I know I gave you reassurance and made you promises, but I just realized we're not compatible. Person 2: What makes us not compatible? Person 1: Emotional intimacy makes me feel overwhelmed, like I'm in a pressure cooker. So I've come up with so many reasons why we don't work, and they're all things I like to change about you. You see I struggle to be introspective and look at myself in the role that I play. Ultimately, I blame my partners, and then I blindside them with a break up. Person 2: Couldn't we have just had a conversation and try to work things through? If feels like you're throwing away this relationship. And you're not even trying to let me in or see what the issues really are. Person 1: Oh I am. At this point I've decided this won't work. And I could really have brought this up sooner, but that would require me to be honest about how I feel, and have difficult conversations. It would require me to actually look at myself in the role that I play. And I don't know how to do that, so I run.

We also need this to release and to rebalance our nervous system. But we suppress this natural response because it's not ""socially accepted"" In a comfortable space, we can let our body do this and notice how calm we feel afterward.

Now push the skin to the right and hold for 30 seconds. Next do the other side. Push the skin firmly to the right and hold for 30 seconds. Now push firmly to the left and hold for 30 seconds. This stimulates the occipital nerve and vagus nerve creating more blood flow to the brain. This will put your body into a rest and digest state. Now test your mobility to the right and left.

She acts like a therapist to one or both of her parents. And never shows her own stress within the chaos. She may appear calm and relaxed but that's because she disassociated years ago to survive in her environment. The only way her anxiety is soothed is by constantly checking in on other people. (this is called emotional monitoring) And making sure no one feels bad or left out. Through the entire process, her needs go unmet and the only identity she knows is by being a caretaker or the glue of the family. She might even hear from family members that they couldn't live without her or that they would fall apart if she wasn't around. Keep in mind this isn't a compliment, and is a sign that they're actually over-relying on and over-depending upon her. And it's also a reminder to her, that no one even notices she's silently suffering.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT49S,49,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/am-z5k7XFrQ/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,121674,12312,,0,358

When things don't go his way he sulks, kind of like me. Mom: Who knew you were noticing all that. Child: Here's my take. I love Grandma, but as a mom she never held dad accountable. She never had any boundaries or limits. She coddled him around the consequences of his own actions. Because she was so overbearing and made him the golden child. He really did miss a lot of maturing. Over time he started to believe that a woman's role was to blindly praise him. And he never learned how to hold space for a woman's emotions. Or how to listen to difficult truths about himself.

Their children really do have an unspoken job, and that job is to soothe their own emotions. Not to have their own opinion and never to talk back. They believe that their children should understand the sacrifices that they made and to praise them consistently for making those sacrifices. They don't understand that children aren't responsible for meeting their parent's emotional needs. Children have their own emotional needs, and it's the parent's responsibility to meet them.

There's a split between your mind and your body. You'll know you're in this state when you feel really checked out, numb or even stuck in place, even though time is passing. You might even look like you're emotionless or that you don't care, but that's the thing about dissociation, you appear really cold and apathetic, but you're really in shutdown mode. So here are 4 quick signs that you might be starting to dissociate. 1. Your brain feels foggy and might even struggle to speak or communicate. 2. Your body is numb and motionless. And often you have no energy. 3. You struggle to feel your emotions, like sadness or anger and you might even worry that something's wrong with you. 4. You feel dizzy. And in some intense cases, you might even feel like you're above yourself or even blacking out. If this resonates: HOW TO GET YOURSELF OUT OF DISSOCIATION 1. Use ice water (just for hands if showers are too intense) take deep breaths and focus on the sensation 2. Use movement like jumping, dancing, shaking, or light stretching 3.

The link between childhood abuse, trauma, and bipolar disorder has been established in the research. What's really happening for many people who have been labeled with this disorder is they're grieving. They're grieving the reality they had to grow up too soon. Or they were violated in their own home. Or they were completely invisible. And no one even noticed or cared if they were even around. Instead of asking what's wrong with you, we need to start asking people what happened to you. Instead of telling people that they're mentally ill, we need to start validating their life experiences. And empowering them with tools like emotional regulation, so they can actually heal.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT40S,40,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lKSVrvRntbU/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,88965,10507,,0,408

Of all the attachment styles, people who are avoidant are most focused on themselves. This is because they grew up in a home with parent figures, who didn't attune to their emotions. For them being distant and hyper independent feels most safe in relationships. They really struggle to be vulnerable. They avoid conflict, and sometimes, they become so overwhelmed with other people's needs, that they actually stop trying to meet them. Their primitive instinct is to focus on themselves. On what they need to do or where they need to get in life. And often their partner comes somewhere after that. This can look like they're extremely selfish, but really the root cause of this behavior is their own fear. And their inability to understand the needs of anyone else.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT46S,46,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pOPQGOP5kPM/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,611789,42039,,0,1408

Where our only focus is on getting through the day or event hat moment.

Every person has their own opinions, their own perspectives and their own way of seeing the world. Just because someone doesn't see things from your perspective, doesn't mean that your perspective isn't true or isn't real. There are multiple truths and multiple realities.

Key signs to look for Therapist: A sign of an unhealthy relationship is constant confusion. Maybe you don't know where you stand with someone. Or they don't understand why they did what they did. Or maybe sometimes they're responsive and loving, and other times they're detached and distant. If you're always wondering or guessing, it's a sign that there's a lack of communication in the relationship, and it's a sign that there's a lack of consistency. Because it's a lack of consistency that really drives confusion. In healthy relationships worlds and actions align, and you can predict the other person's behavior. And you don't always feel like the other shoe is about to drop or that you have to be on guard. Because there's transparency and open communication.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT36S,36,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q-yRDBUeDJo/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,99657,10245,,0,148

From TV and movies, we have this idea that we're gonna meet this perfect person, everything is gonna be smooth and our needs are gonna be met all the time. This only leads to unhealthy expectations and disappointment. Instead of looking for the perfect partner, look for a consistent partner. Find someone who's open with you, who isn't perfect and makes mistakes. But, who will work through conflict with you. They don't have to be someone who shares the same interests or opinions or even someone you like all the time. But, they have to be someone who respects you and shows that they value the relationship. Because compatibility can be built over time. Just like we aren't perfect, there's no one out there that is perfect either. Anyone in a long term relationship, is gonna meet parts of their partner that either bother or trigger them. And this doesn't mean that the relationship is wrong or doomed. It's a sign that we're human, and in all relationships, there are messy parts that aren't fairy tales.","Dr. Nicole,The SelfHealers Circle,How to be the love you seek,How to do the work,how to meet yourself,Holistic healing,Dr. Nicole LePera,Mental health,Healing journey,Self Help",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT54S,54,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/seR8IZOSJHA/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,51289,7966,,0,150

But, you don't know what the truth is. You didn't do anything wrong. You were raised by a parent who couldn't regulate their nervous system.

Growing up you learn to care take people around you in order to manage your environment. Maybe you listen to your mom complain about your dad, or you cleaned up after your siblings because you knew if there was a mess, your dad would go into a rage. And during all of this, you didn't have a parent who was noticing your anxiety. You didn't have someone to reflect back your reality back to you, which is actually how you develop a sense of self. You might have even had a parent who denied what was happening. Or who pretended that what was happening wasn't happening at all. Making you even more anxious and making you want to control the situation even more. So from a young age, you're wired to please and smooth things over. You believe that the only way to be seen is through achievement. By being easy or by projecting the image of a perfect family.

And I would get so upset that people knew things about me that I don't want them to know. It's not that I don't want to talk to you, it's that I can't trust that what I tell you won't be shared. Parent: Ugh I forgot, I'm an awful person so my own child doesn't want to tell me anything.

Emotionally immature parents haven't actually learned how to take care of themselves, so they have a subconscious desire that their children meet their needs. They teach them early to focus on their needs at all times. In childhood this usually looks like oversharing, talking about marital problems or problems at work. Or really anything else that puts the parent in a space to receive sympathy. Because they lack emotional maturity, they can't understand that oh this child is 7 years old, this isn't something that they can understand or support me with. I need to got to a peer because again their subconscious belief is that their children are to be their caretakers. So the adult child of an emotionally immature parent feels so much guilt about what their parents have gone through in the past. And about what they're dealing with now. Even if their parent hasn't changed any of their habits or their behaviors. It's just this heaviness that they feel because they've been conditioned to be a parent pleaser from such a young age. And they truly believe that their role is to parent their parents.","The Holistic Psychologist,Dr. Nicole Lepera",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT58S,58,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1CDtKlEjqxY/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,240993,23601,,0,565

You were essentially raised to act like an emotional thermometer to your parent from a very young age. Always having to know exactly what they were feeling or what they were thinking. And anytime you went to set a boundary, they reacted like ti was a rejection or personal attack. Because in a way to them, it really was. In a childlike way, they can't understand autonomy or needing space. And when they don't listen or respect your boundaries, because you're so emotionally messed with them you believe you're doing something wrong or you're responsible for how they feel.

I don't know I just yet this feeling like something is wrong. Therapist: Well, when you grow up with parents who withhold love to make love very conditional, where you need to perform to get their love, you can grow up having the fear of abandonment. That gets triggered anytime someone needs to withdraw from you. This is why it's so important to practice self-soothing. Our partners might have long days away or just need their own space. And this doesn't mean that they're going to leave or that they're mad at us. And when we give them this space, it shows that we consider them and trust in our bond. The truth is when we have abandonment wounding, no amount of reassurance will actually change the way we feel. It's up to us to teach ourselves to feel safe when a person is away from us.

For many parents, admitting that they had issues or caused you pain brings up a lot of shame. So in order to push that shame away they get defensive or shut down. A lot of people who keep trying to go to a parent to get their trauma validated. And when their parent denies it happens, they end up feeling helpless just like they did as a child. And this keeps them stuck in a loop of feeling unworthy and rejected. This is your reminder, stop going to your parents for validation for the things that happened during your childhood. After they show you that they can't give you that. You don't need your parent's validation to heal. And the more you seek from them what they can't give you, the more you pour salt into your own wound. So work on yourself, get support from people who do understand you and know that you can heal. Even if your parent thinks that you have nothing to heal from.","The Holistic Psychologist,Dr. Nicole Lepera",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT46S,46,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ll8k08Fse00/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,134683,20545,,0,657

You ended up looking outside of yourself a lot of the time. You probably become hyper-aware of changes in people's behaviors in their moods and their tones of voice. Because as a kid you had the job of making sure that everyone around you felt better or was okay. And now as an adult, you probably are still focused on other people to keep yourself safe. This is why so many of us struggle with social events and have social anxiety. When we're in a group of people, all of our energy is spent attuning to or worrying about what other people are thinking or what they're perceiving about us. Instead of attuning to our own internal world and actually connecting with other people. This is why so many of us feel exhausted when we get home after interacting socially. Almost feel like we need time to recover or why some of us only feel at ease or able to relax when we're alone and no one's around to judge us.","The Holistic Psychologist,Dr. Nicole Lepera",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT56S,56,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tzEGvHbpA8o/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,307676,37470,,0,812

Therapist: It sounds like your partner is avoidant. Person: And the more I try to connect with him, the more distant he gets. Therapist: It's helpful to understand that avoidant attachment comes from a childhood where a person usually spends a lot of time alone. And they didn't get much emotional connection from a parent. After getting let down over and over again, they learn to cope by not meeting anyone. Most people who are avoidant are hyper-independent. And take a lot of pride in doing things themselves. Person: yeah and it leaves me feeling really rejected and alone. Therapist: because for you safety is closeness for him safety is distance. When you try to get close his impulse is to move further away. And as he moves further away you're impulse is to get even closer.

Therapist: Have you talked to him about it? Person: Yeah, I tell him I need space at times and then he gets sulky, and then I feel guilty Therapist: The best way to tell a partner that you need space is to reassure them first. Let them know that you love them and that the relationship is a priority for you. And that you also need space to do the things that make you, you. You can let him know that when you get home from work, you'll need some quiet time alone in your room to adjust to being home. And that you'll be out as soon as you decompress. Person: but what if he gets sulky? Therapist: He might, but it's important for him to understand that everyone has different needs in a relationship. Needing space is healthy, and if he's reassured first, he might give you the space that you need. If he guilts you and sulks because you need that space, then it's something deeper, like his own abandonment wound issues are coming up, and that's for him to manage not you.","The Holistic Psychologist,Dr. Nicole Lepera",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT1M,60,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UL250d7NysI/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,48662,3984,,0,65

Self perception is built when our reality is validated and when we learn that what we see and what we’re told algins. When we grow up in homes where reality is denied over and over again, we feel it in our bodies, even as children. It creates that “icky” uncomfortable feeling. This can be an example like this TikTok where our dad is drunk and passed out while a parent puts on a happy face and says he’s just tired from work. Or it can be from experiences where we’re upset or angry about something and we’re told it didn’t happen. Or we’re making a “big deal” out of nothing. Ex: “Daddy hurt me!”— “daddy didn’t hurt you, he loves you” This creates damaged self perception and we start to deny our own reality (or gaslight ourselves.)

Their own internal discomfort and lack of attunement to the emotions of others typically creates a defense mechanism where they dismiss the emotions of others. DISMISSING SOUNDS LIKE: “It’s really not a big deal” “There’s plenty of fish in the sea” “You’re strong, just move on” “Don’t be dramatic” There also tends to be a focus on their own emotional state. In this example the mother gives her own opinion of her daughter’s partner “your father and I never liked him anyway.” The disconnect here is that her daughter is in pain and suffering a very real loss. Emotionally immature parents struggle deeply to step outside of themselves to see that loss. To understand that pain. And to remove themselves from the situation— which is the foundation of support. This is not because the parent doesn’t want to be supportive or is a “bad” parent. It’s because they too lacked that support growing up and do not know how to truly connect. Thankfully, at any time anyone can increase their emotional maturity. The best way to practice is to stop the impulse of sharing how *you* feel. To listen. To just be there with the pain of another instead of trying to dismiss it to remove yourself from the comfort. If you know you have an EIP, the best thing you can do is understand the level of support they’re capable of giving. Find other people who give you the space to self express. It can feel hurtful or frustrating to get responses like this— but they’re not personal.

Adult Child: How'd you do it?  Parent: Well I was attuned to your emotional needs most of the time. I listened when you're upset instead of telling you to stop it. And I taught you how to breathe through intense emotions.  I didn't coddle you because I was confident in your own resilience and most importantly I was predictable.  My words match my behavior.  Adult Child: It's true we never had to walk on eggshells or guess what you were feeling. I knew you were capable. And that helped me become capable. Parent: Exactly, I understood my role as a parent was to work on myself and to heal my own trauma. I also knew that you needed to grow into your own unique person, not who I wanted you to be. So I gave you space to do that.

Then I'm told to come back when I'm not mad anymore.  (Anger tells us when we're being violated, controlled, or need to set a boundary) Parent: Nobody likes someone with a bad attitude.  Child: Well being angry or mad doesn't mean I have a bad attitude. Anger is a guide that shows me when I've been violated or controlled. Anger tells me when I need to stand up for myself or set a boundary.  Parent: Listen you need to be a good girl. And good girls aren't angry okay?  Child: Okay, here's what I'm learning. Anger is an emotion to be ashamed of so instead of understanding my anger and learning how to express it in healthy ways, I'll be punished for it. So I'll repress my anger and in 25 years I'll be afraid to speak for myself and start a pattern of people pleasing. Of course, this will lead to resentment in me, accepting unhealthy behaviors in relationships, but good girls aren't angry.  So I'll put on a big smile and hide everything I'm actually feeling.","The Holistic Psychologist,Dr. Nicole Lepera",27,Education,"Health,Lifestyle_(sociology)",PT52S,52,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ToDaiOt0aIA/maxresdefault.jpg,1,,,,125589,13232,,0,333

Child: You say you want the best for me, but I feel like nothing is ever good enough.  Parent: I do want what's best for you. I just don't understand that what would really be best for you is a safe secure relationship with me.  One where you can make mistakes and explore and just be silly, that's how you develop confidence and a sense of self, not through constant criticism.  Child: So how will this impact me?  Parent: Well you're gonna spend much of your adult life just trying to prove yourself. Trying to be the best at everything. Until one day you wake up and don't really know whose life you're living, and why you're so unhappy.

I just see the best in everyone, and I get that people don't mean to do what they do but I always end up hurt. Therapist: That doesn't sound like you're having empathy for yourself. Self: You have a point. Therapist: What you're describing is actually codependency. Where you subconsciously choose people who need you to gain your own sense of worthiness. It is is very common pattern and it makes sense because that's the role you have played since you were little. Self: Yup that was me. Therapist: What we can work on is creating boundaries. It's great to see the best in people, but we also have to understand that behavior is the most powerful form of communication. So when people's behaviors are hurtful, our role isn't to over-give. It's to be straightforward.

In How to Do the Work, she offers both a manifesto for SelfHealing as well as an essential guide to creating a more vibrant, authentic, and joyful life. Drawing on the latest research from a diversity of scientific fields and healing modalities, Dr. LePera helps us recognize how adverse experiences and trauma in childhood live with us, resulting in whole-body dysfunction—activating harmful stress responses that keep us stuck engaging in patterns of codependency, emotional immaturity, and trauma bonds. Unless addressed, these self-sabotaging behaviors can quickly become cyclical, leaving people feeling unhappy, unfulfilled, and unwell. In How to Do the Work, Dr. LePera offers readers the support and tools that will allow them to break free from destructive behaviors to reclaim and recreate their lives. Nothing short of a paradigm shift, this is a celebration of empowerment that will forever change the way we approach mental wellness and self-care. ""The world needs this book! No matter where you are on your healing journey, How to Do the Work will guide you to stronger relationships, more joy, and a clearer path for your future. We can't always control what happens to us, but Nicole gives us a road map to how to respond from a place of healing and inner peace."" - LEWIS HOWES, New York Times bestselling author of The School of Greatness ""Want more from life?
