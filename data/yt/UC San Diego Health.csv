Erin was diagnosed with primary biliary cholangitis in 2018 at age 38, a chronic and progressive condition that destroys bile ducts in the liver and can ultimately cause liver failure. By age 41, Erin’s healthy, active, sports-centered lifestyle morphed into extreme fatigue, sickness and pain. “I felt so sick every single day, and I was usually in bed before my kids were,” Erin said. But Erin’s Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score wasn’t yet high enough to qualify for a deceased liver transplant, even though her quality of life had drastically diminished. That’s when she learned about UC San Diego Health’s “live liver donation program” that gave her newfound hope. Erin’s sister, Shannon O’Loughlin, wasn’t a match for the living liver donation Erin so desperately needed – but it turned out her husband Henry was. UC San Diego Health’s Center for Transplantation is a national hub of clinical expertise and research and is the region’s leader in transplantation. More than 60 percent of Henry’s liver was removed and transplanted to replace Erin’s liver. The liver has a unique capacity to regenerate, and Henry was up for the challenge. “I felt like the right person for the job,” Henry said. “It’s an endless well of joy seeing Erin do so well.” “Just the disbelief that Henry has done this for me – the selflessness of it, I just feel like I have my very own personal superhero,” Erin said.

Andrew had seizures that were getting closer together over several years. When they became a monthly occurrence, he sought diagnosis and treatment at UC San Diego Health with neurosurgeon Alexander Khalessi, MD, and epilepsy expert Jerry Shih, MD. They determined that the seizures were caused by a tumor in Andrew's right temporal lobe and Dr. Khalessi operated promptly. A longtime fan, Andrew watched the Padres play while recovering from surgery in the intensive care unit at UC San Diego Health. Two months later, he was able to share his enthusiasm for the team with his family at Petco Park. He is grateful for the treatment he received at UC San Diego Health and the chance to live life to the fullest. According to his wife, UC San Diego Health “moved mountains” to provide excellent care. Andrew is also grateful to the San Diego Padres for the opportunity to see the game up close and meet the players.

Nearly five years ago, after finishing a 72-hour shift, his life changed. He couldn’t quite gather his thoughts; he couldn’t read, and his speech was jumbled. An MRI identified Chafe had a transient ischemic attack. It also found something unexpected: a large tumor the size of a golf ball. Due to the size and position of Chafe’s tumor, delicate facial nerves were impacted, leading to facial drooping and paralysis on the right side of his face. His tumor was removed November 2018, which paved the way for a specialized team at UC San Diego Health to repair the damage the tumor caused and ultimately, get his smile back.

Instructions: 1. Pour ingredients and water into the sinus rinse bottle up to the dotted line. If you were instructed to add medication, add it in along with the saline packet. **You can also warm it up in the microwave for about 30 seconds until lukewarm if you prefer for comfort. 2. Secure the tip of the nozzle into one nostril and bend forward over the sink or shower. With the nozzle pointed towards the top of your head, gently squeeze the bottle. The water will flush out your nose and sinus cavities and exit through your opposite nostril or your mouth. Try not to swallow the water, spit it out instead. Rinse about half of the bottle through each side. Make sure you lean forward from the waist and tuck your chin close to your chest. 3. Clean the bottle 1-2 times per week. Rinse out the bottle and wash the tip daily with soap and water. Allow to air dry. About once a week, clean the bottle and the tip by mixing equal parts water and hydrogen peroxide or equal parts water and bleach, shake it thoroughly and squirt the solution out of the tip to clean it through. You can also wash the bottle and tip in the dishwasher 1-2 times per week. Saline Rinse Recipe: 1 teaspoon NON-iodized salt 1 teaspoon baking soda Dissolve in 1 quart (32oz) of boiled or distilled water.

She has been through treatment for three different types of cancers – Hodgkins’s lymphoma, breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. Her most recent diagnosis was pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer. She did her research and decided to receive her cancer care with Andrew Lowy, MD, FACS, surgical oncologist and chief of the Division of Surgical Oncology at Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health. Schwartz underwent the Whipple procedure, a complex surgery that takes several hours and involves removal of the pancreas head and then the duodenum, the first portion of the small bowel. Now, nearly five years post the surgery, Schwartz is living a full life and full of gratitude to the entire medical team who treated her.

The outpatient program is an alternative to the emergency department. Sickle cell disease is a devastating inherited blood disorder that disproportionally affects individuals of African and Hispanic descent. Patients with the condition periodically experience excruciating pain when unhealthy red blood cells block blood flow through tiny blood vessels to the chest, abdomen and joints. Over time, the lack of oxygen to organs and tissues causes permanent damage. “We developed a novel approach to caring for patients with sickle cell disease in medical crisis,” said Srila Gopal, MBBS, hematologist and medical director of the adult sickle cell program at UC San Diego Health. “For patients in sickle cell crisis, intense pain can be accompanied by anemia and infections leading to tissue damage and strokes. Unfortunately, these patients often face bias and discrimination from providers who incorrectly assume that requests for pain management are a 'drug seeking' behavior for opioids rather than a legitimate health emergency.” “Sickle cell disease is a disease of significant health care disparities,” said Patty Maysent, CEO, UC San Diego Health. “Our team took the initiative to investigate the issue and to develop an effective telemedicine strategy and program to help patients receive patient-centered care in a timely fashion.” https://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/Pages/2022-12-12-uc-san-diego-health-recognized-for-health-equity-in-care-of-sickle-cell-crisis.aspx To learn more about the sickle cell program, visit: https://health.ucsd.edu/news/pages/default.aspx","UC San Diego Health,UCSD,Sickle Cell,Infusion Center,San Diego Hospital,Health Care Inequity,California Public Hospital,Patty Maysent,blood disorder,anemia,vaso-occulsive crisis",27,Education,"Health,Society",PT3M57S,237,2d,hd,true,,en-US,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RQi59TIb414/maxresdefault.jpg,,,,,1374,11,,0,

There really is no other reason other than a miracle and what UC San Diego Health did to keep my body going,” Hopson said. “I am thankful for my mindset because I have the ability to use the functions I do have and do amazing things with them.” Hopson learned how to overcome the challenges he faced and is now inspiring many as he continues to meet significant milestones in his recovery, even training for sporting events, like the Paralympic Games. “It’s so great to see him in clinic walking and continuing to push forward and optimize his function to the point that he’s competing in outdoor events,"" said Joel Castellanos, MD. “It’s one of those things where it fills up your tank as a provider, it just makes it all worth it.""

Some people think so, but these two simple, clinical tests prove otherwise. Masks do not hinder breathing and are an essential part of the effort to reduce coronavirus spread. Pulse oximetry is a simple, noninvasive and painless test often conducted in clinics. A small, clip-like device is attached to a body part, typically a finger, toe or earlobe. It uses infrared light to measure oxygen saturation levels in your blood. The higher the levels of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin in the blood, the more infrared light is absorbed. A normal reading is between 95 and 100 percent. Transcutaneous capnometry is also simple, noninvasive and painless. It measures levels of carbon dioxide infused in body tissues, i.e. CO2 not exhaled. A small sensor is placed on the skin. A normal range is between 30 and 45 millimeters of mercury, which is a unit of measurement of pressure. In the video above, you can see what happens to oxygen and CO2 levels when a person wears a mask(s). Wearing Is Caring: Keeping Each Other Safe During COVID-19 Along with social distancing and frequent hand washing, masks are a simple, yet effective, way to slow the spread of COVID-19. How to Safely Put On and Remove Face Masks: https://health.ucsd.edu/coronavirus/Pages/masks.aspx To protect patients and health care workers at UC San Diego Health, we require the use of face coverings in all our facilities. It’s one of the steps that we can all take to keep our community healthy. Masks must be worn at all times in public areas and in patient rooms at our hospitals, clinics and labs. Visitors and patients may wear their own cloth mask if it is clean and well-fitting. Your nose, mouth and chin should be covered.

So what can you do to protect your mental health as the COVID-19 outbreak unfolds? Here are some recommendations from the experts. Put down the smart phone. Take breaks from social media and the news. Give your mind a chance to disconnect. Consider setting up specific times or time limits on how long you spend checking the news each day, so you can stay informed without getting overwhelmed. Take care of yourself. Engage in healthy habits as much as possible. Eat well-balanced meals, get some exercise, get plenty of sleep, and avoid bad habits, like too much alcohol. Enjoy your hobbies. Take the time to engage in relaxing activities, like reading a book, cooking a nice meal, or doing something creative like painting or knitting. Check in with your friends and family. Social distancing doesn’t mean social isolation! Connect with the people you care about to share your concerns and feelings and see how you can help support them. Take a deep breath to avoid burnout. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, stop and take a deep breath. Step back and give yourself space to process your feelings. Consider doing some stretches or yoga, or engaging in a short mindfulness exercise to help keep you grounded.

The collaborative program, pioneered at UC San Diego Health System, has a 100 percent success rate. Pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) deliver energy to the heart through thin, flexible wires or ""leads."" When these leads are not working properly -- due to infection, damage, or scar tissue -- the wires need to be removed and replaced. In particular, old leads can shift over extended periods of time and become improperly attached to the heart and blood vessel walls, and in need of repair. Each year, about 700,000 new heart devices are implanted into patients worldwide, involving about 1.4 million lead wires. When needed, the leads can be removed using a minimally invasive procedure called ""lead extraction."" The leads are accessed through a small incision at the site of the device, just above the heart. The surgeon slides a tube or sheath with a long wire inside the vein and over the lead that needs to be removed. This forms a stable platform for removal. Using X-ray guidance, the surgeon then applies laser energy to dissolve the scar tissue around the lead. This allows the lead to be freed from the blood vessel wall and eventually from its attachment inside the heart. Once the old lead has been removed it can be replaced with a new one. The 100th patient, JenyLyn Carpio, was 22 years old when she experienced a total heart blockage and was diagnosed with a genetic heart disorder that makes her prone to sudden death events.
