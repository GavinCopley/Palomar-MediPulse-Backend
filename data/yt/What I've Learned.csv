The OOLER is the model I use. To be honest, it's probably not powerful enough to replace an AC, but I like the extra control I get with it. In particular, I like how you can mimic a more ""natural"" bed time temperature by setting the the pad to get colder until the middle of the night and then get warm in the morning to wake you up. Light (and the lack of it) is a very important cue for our wake cycles, but so is temperature. Some people were asking for links. Here are amazon affiliate links if you'd like to support the channel: ・L-Theanine: I usually go with this one https://amzn.to/3SaRUmv or this one https://amzn.to/3SaRUmv . IIRC Suntheanine is what has been tested quite a lot but Jarrow formulas is quite reliable in general. ・Tart Cherry Juice: This seems to be the best per fl Oz on the American Amazon: https://amzn.to/3UpyjkK (The one in the video is based in Japan) ・Magnesium: Threonate, Bisglycinate and Citrate are the forms to go for. https://amzn.to/3LimcBG , https://amzn.to/3S6dTv8 , https://amzn.to/3BheqUd ・Collagen Powder: This is the brand I use in Japan: https://amzn.to/3BheqUd 10 grams contains 1.8g of glycine. ・Air Purifier: What you want in an air purifier is a good CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) One evaluation comparing several brands found Blue Air's air purifier to be much better in terms of CADR. (Side note: Dyson sucks apparently) What you see in the video is not actually a blue air because the blue air I got is too big for my small bedroom. https://amzn.to/3DvOdUI ・Mouth tape: I've seen some expensive mouth taping products in Japan but IMO you don't need anything like that, just get some cheap micropore tape: https://amzn.to/3disJjj RE: Mouth taping. Honestly this really helps with my sleep (or should I say NOT taping really screws with my sleep). Not going to lie, over the 5 years of doing this, more than once I have had a nightmare of suffocating which woke me up and had me rip off the tape but I'm still here. A properly working human body should wake up when it detects insufficient air flow rather than just letting you die. You might want to just use strips of tape in a way that your lips are held together, but can otherwise breathe through the mouth if necessary. Actually I'm pretty sure my sleep is better when I completely seal my mouth, but I usually make two strips so there can be a slight slit in the center to breathe through in case my nose stuffs up in the middle of the night for some reason. It's not good to tape your mouth if you've been drinking or ate too much.

I started working on this video with the idea of ""How can we make our daily lives more satisfying by incorporating more 'completion' into them?"" but this video looks at that from the opposite angle.

I figured the first step with that was to figure out why *anything* is satisfying. Since we call a lot of things satisfying, this was harder than I expected. When things are in perfect sync it's satisfying, when things are in perfect order is satisfying, it's satisfying when you are arranging your new living room and then the short square table you have fits perfectly between your two sofas and the surface of the table is flush with both sofa's arm rests. (Fun fact: in Japanese, you just say ""feels good"" (kimochi ii) for things like this) Unsurprisingly, there's not much research on the concept of ""satisfying."" Then I started looking into why we find things pleasurable. Jaak Panksepp says that things that are pleasurable are *biologically useful* . So it was even more curious that things seemingly irrelevant to keeping us alive should make us feel good. This video is the result of cobbling a bit of logic with information from books on Satisfaction, neuroscience, 'what the brain finds beautiful' as well as various research papers on the brain. I hope it's satisfying. (If editing videos didn't take so gotham long, this video would be about an hour) I still plan on making a ""why oddly satisfying videos are satisfying"" video at some point.

Since I expect more comments about this, I'll point out just one thing for now: ( *TLDR* : Youtuber makes a video saying I've misrepresented a study - say my words don't match the study I referenced. He was looking at the wrong study.) At 11:22 of the video response he says ""This is where things get really bad and I think he needs to correct this in some way..."" and brings up the part of my video where I said ""Unfortunately, it looks like iron supplements don't cut it for pregnant women. Despite taking prenatal vitamins with iron, 58% of the women had iron levels below normal."" He goes on to say that he looked forever at this study that I referenced, only to find that this 58% figure was no where in the study and that I was blatantly misrepresenting the study. Moreover, he says ""Worst of all, this [study] actually undermines his whole video on heme iron, because all 19 of those women were given heme iron throughout their pregnancy..."" That is, he's suggesting that if there is a 58% of women who had low levels of iron despite supplementing with iron, these women were actually supplementing with heme iron and therefore heme iron is not effective for maintaining iron levels in pregnant women. Ironically, this is a misinterpretation on his part. The reason he couldn't find that 58% figure in that particular paper of mine he was looking at was because it was the wrong study. The source for the statement ""Despite taking prenatal vitamins with iron, 58% of the women had iron levels below normal"" is NOT the study he was looking at - ""Maternal hepcidin is associated with placental transfer of iron derived from dietary heme and nonheme sources.""

There is a rebuttal video titled 'What I've Learned' is Wrong about Bacon and Cancer. Flaws with that video at a glance: -While I did not mean to suggest “sodium nitrite added to bacon makes it good for the arteries” in my video, Mic does not present sufficient evidence to claim nitrate/nitrite from the plants is good whereas nitrite from bacon is bad. (Fun fact: 93% of the total ingestion of nitrite is derived from saliva) -Skips over some very complicated science with ad hominem logic. -Misinterprets me as saying ‘nitrosamines cannot be formed in the body,’ I didn’t say this. -Confuses red meat with processed meat. -Uses studies that are looking at “apparent total nitrosamines” rather than specific nitrosamines in meat. This is important because there are several types of nitrosamines with different severity of effects on the body. -His data for endogenous formation of NDMA is based on ​in vitro​ studies ​looking not at red meat,​ but fish, and in specific, a type of fish that has the specific precursor to NDMA (DMA) in its muscle. Meat does not typically have this precursor. The study even found no NDMA formation from grilled meat. -Mic confuses ​total endogenously formed NDMA​ with ​NDMA formed endogenously as the result of eating red meat/processed meat.​ (The study he references makes no mention of endogenous NDMA formation ​via meat consumption​.)

As for the sleep experiment, I'm thinking of doing: Week 1 - Sleep on my bed with a pillow. I will try to fall asleep on my side and will try not to use the pillow to lay on my back. Week 2 - On bed, no pillow. Week 3 - On floor with padding. Whether I make the pillow available or not will depend on on the results from Week 1 and 2. *I'll aim for at least 5 days of data per week to have some leeway for if I go out and the results are skewed by alcohol or what have you. ▪︎For tracking: Subjective quality: Notebook Sleep quality data: Garmin vivosmart Snoring: Snorelab App Sleep position: Baby monitor camera thing?

Considering the airway is at the back of the face, having a receded chin or maxilla could hinder your airway, having big implications for sleep apnea. Clarification on the title: I of course don't mean to suggest that attractiveness depends *only* on tongue posture. Nutrition of the mother and nutrition of the person during formative years surely play a very large role in how the face develops. In fact, the book Nutrition and Physical Degeneration would suggest that; fat soluble vitamins being very important for fertility and proper development of young, with grains & sugar (""modern foods"") being very detrimental for development and oral health especially. Oral posture would be another piece of the puzzle. NOTE ON SUTURE FUSION: I wish I had used the phrasing ""these sutures are not *completely* fused together,"" or ""sutures are not *completely closed* ..."" It's understood that after birth, the sutures of the skull ""fuse"" together by age 2 or so. One study found that complete closure of certain sutures does not occur until as late as 70 years old. Another found that “The human frontozygomatic suture undergoes synostosis during the eigth decade of life, but does not completely fuse by the age of 95 years"" based on 61 human cadavers aged 20 to 95.

If this sounds like something you might be able to benefit from, I encourage you to do your research before taking any action - look into possible side effects, make sure you understand precisely when you're supposed to take this, what is an appropriate dose for you and so on. Again, I'm not a doctor - this video is meant to inform, not to make medical recommendations. Some things to keep in mind while reading about this: -The Sinclair Method, stated simply is this: Take 50mg of Naltrexone 1 hour before drinking. Do not take it when you are not drinking. Try to avoid doing naturally rewarding things while the medication is still in your system. Remember, other activities like exercise, hugging people, and eating food are felt to be pleasurable and are reinforced through the opioid system.

For example, Benny Lewis has some great approaches to language, but I don't agree with ""Use the Language from Day 1"" unless you are entirely comfortable embarrassing yourself in front of strangers. As per Krashen's Input Theory, The affective filter hypothesis states that learners' ability to acquire language is constrained if they are experiencing negative emotions such as fear or embarrassment. I totally agree with this based on my experience and think this is why ""classroom language teaching"" does not work. You are risking embarrassment every time the teacher calls on you and may be in fear of failing as you study the language. ◆Also, I do not think techniques for ""memorizing"" words are a good use of your time, unless you are taking a language test. If your aim is to learn the language to where you can understand media in that language and have enjoyable conversations, then mnemonics are not helpful. This is because they facilitate ""learning"" of the language and not ""acquisition."" For example, if someone says ""Do you know what taberu means?"" You can access your mnemonic of ""I eat on a table [TABEru means eat!],"" but if someone says to you ""issho ni gohan tabenai?"" you probably won't be able to rapidly comprehend this phrase and respond in a natural way. ◆The distinction between acquisition and learning is tricky, but very important to keep in mind while you develop methods to acquiring your target language in an efficient manner. ・Beginner Vocabulary: Try and find the ""Core 100"" words of your target language. After you get those down, move on to the next 100 and so on. The ""core"" is the most commonly used words (make sure the list you get distinguishes between the 100 most commonly used spoken words and written words) Relevant resource: https://fluent-forever.com/the-method/vocabulary/base-vocabulary-list/ ・Beginner Grammar: I recommend Tim Ferriss's ""13 Sentences for introducing yourself to the Grammar. https://youtu.be/dxqo47eGOLs?t=178 SHADOWING ・Shadowing is simply finding a clip of a native speaker speaking and mimicking everything about their speech - pacing, intonation, cadence, and most importantly of course: pronunciation ・Try and shadow with video clips that show the speakers mouth so you can copy their mouth positioning. ・Especially if you're a beginner, do not attempt to shadow everything. For example a beginner shadowing session of an English sentence like ""Hey bro I was thinking we should go grab some steak at that place around the corner when we finish work."" would be like ""Hey bro .... grab some... around the corner.... work."" In short, you don't want to rush yourself to try and copy everything because you will mumble and that is not a good habit ・Be attentive of your frustration level. Shadowing is super hard and challenging. Let your goal be to slowly increase the amount of time you can sit in frustration. For example, one day you start shadowing, get super frustrated because you feel like you can't get more than 3 syllables right at a time and give up in 10 minutes. No problem. See if you can sit in that frustration for 11 minutes the next day. Don't overload yourself and turn language learning into a chore or you'll become more and more averse to doing language acquisition and shoot yourself in the foot. ・BEGINNERS may be especially frustrated, but even a little bit of shadowing will be very helpful. Work your way up from just 5 minutes or so. ・Get apps like ""Video Speed Controller"" for chrome so you can quickly adjust the video's speed on the fly. (Being able to quickly adjust the speed is helpful if you have one character in a TV show who mumbles and other characters who speak really clearly) ・RECORD yourself. This is a tip from @Dogen, and I wish I implemented this more often when I was learning Japanese, it adds more time to your practice, but really does reveal where your pronunciation is lacking. JAPANESE ・If you're trying to improve your Japanese skills, particularly pronunciation, I recommend checking out @Dogen .

Some might call it ""extreme"" or ""dangerous"" or ""a really bad idea,"" but is it? Many people are having several health conditions healed by eating this diet, some are having improvements despite having been doing a paleo diet or keto diet. People are having relief from arthritis, psoriasis, and various inflammatory conditions, and yes they are experiencing weight loss too. But what about nutrients? Isn't a lack of vitamin C going to give them all scurvy? What about constipation due to no fiber? And why would cutting out plants heal people? This is what the video addresses.

Nutrition is always complicated, as the human body is - this topic is no different.

If you've been doing intermittent fasting for more than a week and are still having trouble with sleep, you should try shifting your eating window to earlier in the day (why is partly explained near the end of this video). However, (this may be unfortunate news...) it seems that coffee starts this eating window. As Dr. Rhonda Patrick says on the Joe Rogan show (https://youtu.be/uxM_CLsvieE?t=2h34m45s - Should start at time stamp 2:34:45) : Caffeine is a xenobiotic, it has to be metabolized. The first thing non-water thing you put into your body is going to start all these different clocks that affect metabolism, so after the clock starts, you want to consume everything in at least a 12 hour time frame (& earlier in the day) to reap the benefits of more optimized metabolism.

I tried several things to try and make myself less hungry without breaking the fast, but what was most helpful was knowing that it would go away on its own, and why this was the case.

This is already twice as much as what was said to be effective for inhibiting alcohol intoxication in the study I mentioned. I’ve actually had good results even when it’s not heated or mixed with fat, so it will probably still help if you just drink it with water if you’re in a rush. There are plenty of recipes online to make the mixture more tasty. The paper I referenced earlier said that “Dose-escalating studies have indicated the safety of curcumin at doses as high as 12 g/day over 3 months,” so most people should be OK to ramp up the dosage when it seems necessary. Then again, turmeric has been reported to have adverse effects when taken excessively. Some sources have recommended that if you’re going to make this a daily thing, you should limit intake of turmeric to only 1.5 g per day.

This is definitely in line with the point of the video. Myself included, (it seems) most of us are constantly trying to find ways to keep ourselves operating at a faster, more productive, more focused pace. Like turning up the volume on the stereo when we want to hear more clearly, we try and will ourselves to focus ""harder"" as well as amp our brains' ability to focus by taking stimulants like coffee. The kind of improvement that meditation provides isn't so much like this- instead, it's like hearing more clearly by walking into a quieter room.

Upton Sinclair recommends doing quite long fasts - 12 days, but you may want to work your way up to longer fasts. Unless you are relatively keto adapted (or have experience with fasting of course), it's important that you take precautions while doing a fast. Fasting isn't inherently dangerous, *but diving into fasting when your body is in no way geared for it can be.* I recommend doing more research before doing longer fasts. ""The Complete Guide to Fasting"" (http://amzn.to/2tQjxXa) is a good book to start with. As Tim Ferriss puts it: Please don't do anything stupid and kill yourself. It would make us both quite unhappy. Just in case I should also say that of course you need to balance fasting with eating - You need to survive off of something. I have been doing intermittent fasting the past year (22 hours fasted, 2 hours eating - you can widen it to 16/8, which still provides great benefits) and will fast for a couple days every other month or so. Several other people have recommend a routine like this - Tim Ferriss recommends doing a 3 day fast once per month and a 7 day fast once per year. Also make sure you're getting enough fat, protein, micronutrients and fiber to maintain a healthy weight and healthy body - *excessive* fasting can be very dangerous.

It is a very valuable technique and I'm quite certain it has improved my health personally, and has improved my meditation focus. However, the explanation I often see given for what is happening when you practice the breathing technique is incomplete and can be misleading. For example, the tingling you feel is due to a lack of oxygen availability, NOT because you have more oxygen. If someone wanted to push harder thinking they're getting super charged with Oxygen this could be detrimental. I have a lot of respect for Wim Hof and don't intend to criticize him at all. I simply want to clarify some points about certain physiological processes so it can help more people get the most out of this very interesting and useful technique. ★3:20 - My breathing is a bit too fast here. See Wim's demonstration at 1:28 for the proper pace. Just to be clear: when I do the breathing at the proper pace the Pulse Oximeter shows the same results, the same tingling patterns arise and the same phenomenon I describe will occur (increased breathing volume leading to hypocapnia and decreased oxygen availability as per the bohr effect.)

The series Stranger Things has somewhat brought the term ""mouth breather"" back into circulation, but there needs to be more education on the importance of avoiding breathing through the mouth at all times - even when asleep. Patrick McKeown's book ""The Oxygen Advantage"" ( http://amzn.to/2p66IIz ) is a must-read book for anyone who breathes. Everyone else, you're off the hook. - - - - - - - - MOUTH TAPING & Stuffed Noses Some points about the mouth taping to be careful. For the most part taping the mouth isn't dangerous unless you have a nasal obstruction. If you can't breathe with the tape on then you wouldn't fall asleep in the first place. However it is possible that in the middle of the night you could roll into some position that makes it hard to breathe through the nose, which should just cause you to roll over again or you'd just wake up. However, just in case: ■Make the tape easy to take off: You can pat the piece of tape on the back of your hand to remove some of the adhesive before putting it on. Fold it at both ends to make a tab you can pull on to take it off ■Don't tape your mouth after drinking alcohol (or drugs) and it's better not to wear it if you've eaten dinner soon before bed. Patrick McKeown recommends to finish dinner at least 2 hours before sleeping ■If it makes you anxious, try just wearing the tape while awake until you're comfortable with it. If you really don't like the idea of taping your mouth, you can get an anti-snoring chin strap instead which will keep your mouth closed. [Stuffed Nose] Patrick McKeown addresses this in the book, here's one of the nose unblocking techniques: -Sit in a chair -After a gentle exhalation, close your mouth and pinch your nostrils -Gently nod your head back and forth until you feel the urge to breathe. -Keep your mouth closed but attempt to gently inhale through the nose -Unless you simply cannot breathe through the nose at this point, continue to breathe lightly in and out through your nose. -If the nose is still stuffed, repeat the exercise.
