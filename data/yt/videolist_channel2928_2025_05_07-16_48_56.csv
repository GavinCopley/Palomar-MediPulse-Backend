AUD treatment is available in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Ms. Aguirre will walk you through each of these options and reasons why you may want to choose one form of treatment over another. To find treatment, you may start by contacting your insurance provider who can provide a list of in-network behavioral health providers. You can also ask for a referral from your primary care provider (PCP). A third option is to search online in directories like psychologytoday.com and through the NIAAA Navigator. In the last part of this video, Ms. Aguirre will walk you through a real life demonstration of using these two websites.

Wang, MD, UCLA Moyamoya Program |UCLA Health","Jeremiah Johnson, MD, FAANS, and Anthony Wang, MD explain moyamoya disease, which involves the narrowing of blood vessels in the brain. Moyomoya is rare and affects people of all ages, but it accounts for 10-20% of all strokes that occur in children. When a person has moyamoya, backup blood vessels form in the brain to make up for the lack of blood and oxygen caused by narrowing. Compared to healthy blood vessels, those backup vessels are smaller and weaker. Over time, moyamoya can cause bleeding in the brain or a stroke. The most common symptoms of moyamoya disease include brain bleeding (hemorrhage), headaches, personality changes, cognitive dysfunction, problems with senses (sight, touch, hearing, taste, smell) and seizures. There is no cure for moyamoya at this time, but treatments can help manage symptoms and prevent serious complications like seizure and stroke. Bypass surgery using donor arteries can help divert blood flow. In this webinar, Dr. Wang shows a bypass surgery and explains how the procedure is performed.

Callbacks after a mammogram are relatively common and often result in normal findings. During your callback visit, you can expect more imaging tests like mammograms and ultrasounds. If necessary, your doctor might recommend a biopsy, but remember, a callback alone is not a breast cancer diagnosis. It's essential to follow through with recommended tests and appointments for early detection and peace of mind. Make sure to provide any past breast imaging, arrive early, and expect your visit to take about 45 to 60 minutes. Your care team will explain your results after the exam, and they are here to support and answer any questions you have.

On the day of your mammogram, arrive 15 minutes early to fill out any required paperwork on an iPad. Once your care team is ready for you, they will guide you through the mammogram process, during which a state-of-the-art 3D mammogram captures detailed breast images. After your mammogram is complete, imaging results will be available in your MyChart patient portal called myUCLAHealth. You will also receive your results in the mail.

Before surgery, it's natural to have questions. Jot them down to ensure nothing's missed during your consultation. Once you're set on surgery, a UCLA Health scheduler will help you choose a date and location among our three centers. Leading up to your surgery, eat a balanced diet with lean protein and exercise 20 minutes each day to prep your body. Around three weeks before your surgery date, we'll help you finalize pre-operative tasks and insurance arrangements to minimize financial stress. Fasting is important. Avoid solid food for eight hours before surgery and clear liquids for two hours before. Plan to arrive about two hours ahead of the surgery time. If you live an hour away or more, plan to be in the West L.A. area three hours prior. The operating room nursing staff will guide you through the pre-op process. If you have any questions or concerns, talk to your doctor.

This butterfly-shaped gland in your neck regulates metabolism and relies on iodine from your diet to create thyroid hormones. Similar to how a gas pedal works, TSH controls thyroid hormone production. Elevated TSH signifies underproduction (hypothyroidism), while low TSH indicates overproduction (hyperthyroidism).

In this video, UCLA Health endocrinologist Angela Leung explains. One of the most common symptoms of thyroid cancer is a thyroid nodule. These bumps on the thyroid are common ‚Äî by the time you reach age 50, it's more likely that you will have a thyroid nodule than not. Only around 1 in 10 to 20 thyroid nodules are cancerous. Many people who are diagnosed with thyroid cancer don‚Äôt experience any symptoms, and most thyroid nodules have minimal impact on thyroid function. Sometimes large nodules can cause trouble swallowing or a hoarse voice, but most thyroid cancers are detected when smaller. It‚Äôs important to note that thyroid nodules (cancerous or benign) usually don't cause pain; consult your doctor if you experience discomfort.

Parathyroid glands, nestled near your thyroid, produce parathyroid hormone (PTH). This hormone is a calcium regulator, so it plays a pivotal role in maintaining balanced blood calcium levels. PTH helps raise blood calcium levels by prompting bones to release calcium, enhancing calcium absorption from food, and lowering calcium loss through urine. When there‚Äôs a parathyroid hormone imbalance, like hyperparathyroidism, it can cause health issues. If you're concerned about your parathyroid hormone levels or related symptoms, talk to your doctor for more personalized guidance.

Your thyroid gland impacts crucial functions like metabolism, energy levels and body temperature. After surgery, you might have to replace the hormones it can no longer produce on its own. If your entire thyroid was removed, medication is a must. But if only part of the thyroid was taken out, the need for medication depends on the reason behind the surgery. In most cases, you might be prescribed levothyroxine, a synthetic thyroid hormone. This medication is like what your thyroid used to make naturally. Remember that every patient is unique.

Their conversation then covers The Practice of Groundedness from a high level view and how this is an improved approach to performance. They discuss initial concepts on the practice such as, focusing on the process (instead of the goal), acceptance, tempering expectations, and our sense of self and identity. Please look out for part B of this episode coming soon.

During this procedure, surgeons insert an endoscope (camera) through the nose and expose and remove tumors from base of the brain. Guided by the endoscope camera, specially designed microsurgical instruments are used to dissect and remove the tumor. There is no facial incision, no visible scar and often fewer side effects for patients. If left untreated, pituitary and anterior skull base tumors can cause many health problems, including Cushing‚Äôs disease. In ideal cases, surgery can remove the tumor and resolve symptoms. Endoscopic transnasal surgery is a groundbreaking treatment because it allows doctors to see and remove tumors in otherwise difficult to reach areas ‚Äî without a skin incision, with increased precision and better results.

These small glands are located near the thyroid gland and produce a hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH). This hormone helps control the levels of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D in the blood. Maintaining the right level of calcium in your blood is essential for your health, as it helps keep your bones strong and your body functioning properly. If the calcium levels in your blood get too low, the parathyroid glands release PTH, which tells your body to start absorbing more calcium from your food and releasing it from your bones. But if your calcium levels get too high, the parathyroid gland releases less PTH, which helps prevent your body from absorbing too much calcium from your food or releasing too much from your bones. It's important to maintain the right balance of calcium levels in your body, and if you're experiencing any symptoms related to the parathyroid glands, talk to your doctor.

When someone has a subdural hematoma, blood collects in the space between the surface of the brain and the inner lining of the skull. As the subdural hematoma grows, it puts pressure on the brain, and can cause headaches, confusion, seizures, imbalance and more. By 2030, researchers say that chronic subdural hematomas will be one of the most common surgical conditions requiring treatment by neurosurgeons. One minimally invasive treatment technique is middle meningeal arterial (MMA) embolization. During this procedure, the doctor directs a small catheter through the arteries into the MMA blood vessel in the underlining of the skull called the dura matter. Through the catheter, the surgeon releases particles or glue to reduce MMA blood flow which prevents future bleeding and promotes healing. Watch the webinar to learn more about how UCLA Health surgeons are using this emerging surgical treatment for chronic subdural hematomas.

One of the main causes of thyroid nodules is increased age. The longer we live, the more likely some of our thyroid cells will develop abnormally into a clump of cells (nodule). Anything that interferes with thyroid function can also cause thyroid nodules. For example, since the thyroid uses iodine to create the thyroid hormone, being iodine deficient can lead to the formation of nodules. Studies have linked other factors to thyroid nodules including smoking, obesity and drinking alcohol. Most thyroid nodules aren‚Äôt an issue, but it‚Äôs important to make sure a thyroid nodule isn‚Äôt interfering with your thyroid function. You should also have the nodule checked for any features suspicious for thyroid cancer.

Some families have genetic mutations that put them at greater risk for thyroid cancer, which is why family health history is important to discuss with your provider. Most patients haven‚Äôt been exposed to radiation and they don‚Äôt have a family health history of thyroid problems. In these cases, it‚Äôs unknown exactly what causes thyroid cancer. Several studies have looked at smoking, obesity, pesticides and other factors, but the data isn‚Äôt strong enough to prove a direct correlation to thyroid cancer.

This condition is treated by taking a pill form of the thyroid hormone. There are two types of thyroid hormones in the body: T3 and T4. Patients can take synthetic T3 or T4, but the most common is T4. Another way to get more of the thyroid hormone that your body needs is through dried animal thyroid glands, usually from pigs or cows. This is called desiccated thyroid or thyroid extract. For this option, the amount of T3 and T4 hormones in each pill can vary, so it‚Äôs important to discuss this method with your provider. If you have questions or concerns about thyroid hormones, reach out to your health care provider or endocrinologist.

It‚Äôs determined through a special X-ray of your bones called a DEXA scan. This imaging test scans your hips, spine and sometimes wrists. A computer uses the scan to calculate the T-score, which helps doctors understand how dense your bones are, says endocrinologist Yaroslav Gofnung, MD. A normal T-score is between 0 and -1. A T-score between -1 and -2.5 is considered osteopenia. A T-score below -2.5 is considered osteoporosis. The lower the T-score, the higher the risk of breaking a bone. Tracking a T-score over time allows doctors to monitor a person‚Äôs response to treatment if they‚Äôve already been diagnosed with osteoporosis. It can also help doctors determine when (or if) to start or stop treatment. Talk to your health care provider or endocrinologist if you have any questions about a bone mineral density scan.

Sometimes the results come back as indeterminant, which means it‚Äôs unknown if the cells are benign or cancerous. When this happens, the experts at UCLA Health can analyze the genetics of the biopsy. This method is highly accurate and will determine if the cells are suspicious or benign. A third possible result is nondiagnostic, which means the pathologist didn‚Äôt have enough cells to make a conclusion. This often requires a second biopsy. To avoid this result, a cytotechnologist assists in the biopsy to ensure the pathologist has enough cells for a clear diagnosis.

A common test checks thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Originating from the pituitary gland, TSH tells your body to make the thyroid hormone. If a test shows your TSH value is too high, it usually indicates hypothyroidism. This means the body isn‚Äôt producing enough of the thyroid hormone or you‚Äôre taking too little thyroid hormone medication. On the other hand, a low TSH value often indicates hyperthyroidism ‚Äî when the body produces too much thyroid hormone. A normal TSH value usually means the thyroid is functioning as it should.

These masses, called adrenal incidentalomas, occur in about 7 percent of people by age 70. Most are noncancerous and don‚Äôt cause problems, but some lead to serious disease. Treatment is required if the masses are cancerous or make too many hormones. To find out if the mass is cancerous, doctors usually order a special CT scan. This scan shows the size, density and borders of the tumor. Cancerous tumors are usually bigger than 6cm, are dense and have irregular borders. While rare, some cancerous adrenal tumors are smaller than 6cm, so it‚Äôs important to consider all of the tumor‚Äôs characteristics. Surgery is often recommended to treat adrenal incidentaloma, says endocrine surgeon Avital Harari, MD. If you choose not to remove the mass, it‚Äôs important to have close follow-up with regular imaging and labs to see if the mass changes, which happens in about 20 percent of patients.

Prognosis depends on the type of thyroid cancer, how far it has spread and your age. Younger age is better ‚Äî with most thyroid cancers, you can‚Äôt present with an advanced stage if you‚Äôre under 55 years old. To determine how dangerous the thyroid cancer is, you need to know whether it has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes. A neck ultrasound can identify any spreading, and treatment is often successful even when cancers have spread to the lymph nodes. For the best thyroid cancer outcomes, your health care team should treat the thyroid and any lymph nodes involved. This usually includes having surgery to remove half or all the thyroid gland. A small number of thyroid cancers are more aggressive than others ‚Äî they may spread faster and have worse outcomes. There are treatments available at UCLA Health for later staged, more aggressive types. No matter the type or stage of thyroid cancer, treatment is crucial. Follow-up after treatment for all patients with thyroid cancer is important since it can come back. If you have questions about your unique cancer, talk to your surgeon and endocrinologist.

This causes the gland to produce too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism). Without treatment, this autoimmune disease can lead to heart failure, heart irregularities and osteoporosis. One treatment option for Grave‚Äôs disease or hyperthyroidism is medication, says endocrine surgeon Avital Harari, MD. If hyperthyroidism continues, treatment with radioactive iodine (RAI) or surgery can help. Surgery for Graves‚Äô disease involves removing half or the entire thyroid (thyroidectomy). To qualify for surgery your thyroid hormone levels need to be under control. After surgery, some people have a raspy voice, which can be temporary or permanent. It‚Äôs possible to have low calcium after surgery but taking calcium supplements can help. There‚Äôs also a risk of bleeding, which sometimes requires another surgery.

If your calcium levels are too low, you could have vitamin D deficiency, trouble absorbing calcium from your diet or kidney problems. If your calcium level is high, your doctor will likely recheck it to ensure it wasn‚Äôt a lab error. At UCLA Health, any calcium level above 10.4 is considered high. If your calcium levels are still high after a recheck, more blood tests are needed to determine the cause.

She‚Äôs been to Nepal, China, Haiti, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ecuador. Huang, UCLA Health‚Äôs director of pediatric nursing, loves the international work so much she intends to dedicate herself to it full time when she retires. The COVID-19 pandemic put a halt to trips abroad in 2020. And then came 2021 ‚Äì and in a surprise development, Huang found herself working full time on an international humanitarian mission right here at home. In April, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services tapped UCLA Health to provide medical care for unaccompanied migrant children from Central America at a new federal shelter at the Long Beach Convention Center. In less than 24 hours, UCLA Health workers set up an urgent care clinic, pharmacy, medical exam rooms and a COVID-19 isolation unit inside the empty convention center, along with a secure computer network to establish and track health records for every child. Huang has been overseeing nursing efforts at the emergency-intake site since it opened, caring for the more than 700 children who have passed through the center. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs amazing: We went from zero workload, zero protocol, to the robust infrastructure we have now,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what makes me so proud of UCLA.

However, many families in smaller cities or rural areas do not have convenient access to such programs, often located at larger universities in big cities. To address that need, researchers at UCLA are using telemedicine to remotely help families learn skills that let them work at home with their children to gain essential social skills. One such study involves children with tuberous sclerosis, a rare genetic disorder that often causes development issues. Scientists found early signs of autism in this group of infants who, until now, would never have received crucial early intervention.

Call 911 or get another person to do so. Find the source of the bleeding and cover the wound with a cloth or an article of clothing and apply direct, steady, pressure with both hands until help arrives. If the person is unconscious, lay them on their side with the wound up if possible. Once the bleeding is under control, just make sure the injured person is breathing well and comfortable. If you can‚Äôt stop the bleeding with continuous direct pressure, you can apply a tourniquet. Applying a tourniquet requires another person to help and should only be done as a last resort.

At five years old, she is a bright light of smiles, love and curiosity. But Willow‚Äôs future looked dim when she was born at less than 23 weeks, about half the length of a normal gestation. Just 14 ounces, Willow weighed about the same as a football. Her parents, Stephanie and Joseph, who live in Bakersfield, were told that Willow had only a five percent chance of surviving. She had serious respiratory issues and needed surgery to correct a heart defect. Stephanie and Joseph decided to put their trust in the UCLA Mattel Children‚Äôs Hospital NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) After four months in the NICU, Willow was finally strong enough to go home. Her parents were grateful for the care they received at UCLA. ‚ÄúEveryone from the doctors to the respiratory therapists to the housekeeping staff made us feel like we were taken care of and a vital part of Willow‚Äôs team,‚Äù said Stephanie. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a place that exemplifies a culture of care,‚Äù said Joseph. Willow, her sister, parents and grandparents visited the UCLA Health Training Center and spent a day touring the facility. Willow met two Laker Girls who presented her with her own Laker Girls outfit and practiced some cheers with her. Willow couldn‚Äôt have been happier as she learned dances and cheers with the girls. Her presence really lit up the floor. Two weeks later, the family returned for a Lakers game, dining in the Chairman‚Äôs Lounge and hanging out with the Laker Girls during the game. It was a great day for a sunny little girl and her family. During a timeout, Willow and some of the Laker Girls took the floor for her recognition.

Getting to this point has not been easy for Vivian, who was born with a complex congenital heart defect. At just 10 days old, she had open-heart surgery and spent the first six months of her life in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. She has had multiple surgeries and cardiac interventions since. Through it all, Vivian‚Äôs spirit has never wavered. The courage and perseverance she displayed during her treatment helped earn her UCLA Kid Captain honors for the Bruins‚Äô football season opener against Cincinnati on Sept. 1 at the Rose Bowl. ‚ÄúVivian is very excited to be Kid Captain.

Vivian and her family also watched warm-ups on the field and met Joe and Josie Bruin, the school‚Äôs mascots.

Donovan stared in awe as Kuzma pulled out custom Lakers jerseys for him and his siblings. They all put on their jerseys and played HORSE on the team‚Äôs practice court. Kuzma made things easy at first, then turned up the competitiveness to seal a friendly win against Donovan and his family. Of course, Donovan has scored his share of victories. That he could even participate in such a moment with a member of his beloved Lakers is proof enough. Donovan was born with pulmonary atresia, a type of heart disease in which the pulmonary valve does not form properly. He counts three open-heart surgeries and five stint surgeries among the health hurdles he has overcome, so it‚Äôs easy to see why he enjoyed being the UCLA Health Laker for a Day so much. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been a Lakers fan ever since I could remember,‚Äù says Donovan. As part of his Laker for a Day experience, Donovan had an amazing time at the UCLA Health Training Center ‚Äì the home of the Lakers. He watched practice with his brothers Duncan, Brody and Isaiah as well as one of his sisters, Frankie, and their parents, Inez and Mike. The Lakers had more than one surprise for Donovan. They first brought Donovan to the court to watch the end of their practice, where he met and took pictures with Lakers coach Luke Walton and 7-footer JaVale McGee. The Lakers invited Donovan and his family to shoot around on the same floor where the team had just practiced, and that‚Äôs when Kuzma came out of the locker room for the jersey surprise. The family also received a tour of the team‚Äôs headquarters. Their favorite part was seeing the sparkling championship rings outside of Lakers owner Jeanie Buss‚Äô office, where they debated which ring had the most diamonds in it. Donovan arrived early to the Lakers‚Äô game against Phoenix on Jan. 27, watching warm ups and getting to hang out in the Chairman‚Äôs Lounge for dinner. The fans applauded Donovan when the video of his story played during an on-court presentation, a moment Donovan and his family will always cherish. ‚ÄúHe always says to me, ‚ÄòI got to do well. I shouldn‚Äôt be living, so I got to make the best of my life,‚Äô‚Äù says Donovan‚Äôs father, Mike. ‚ÄúI go, ‚ÄòWell, you will.‚Äô‚Äù","Lakers,UCLA Health,#TeamUCLALakers,TeamUCLALakers,Heart,Heart Month,Basketball,Kuzma,Kyle Kuzma,Kuzmania,Health,Laker For A Day,Community",28,"Science & Technology","Basketball,Sport",PT2M40S,160,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9uBkphcWj_0/maxresdefault.jpg,,,,,516,5,,0,0

She was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes as a youngster, received a kidney transplant as an adult and later developed urinary tract infections, among other complications. Despite enduring so much already, Shebyon had to overcome yet another major health hurdle: breast cancer. Shebyon has endured through it all, and her perseverance earned her special recognition as a UCLA Health Laker For A Day honoree this December. But all she ever really wanted was to be healthy enough to spend time with her sister, two daughters and three grandchildren, and so of course she used the opportunity to include them in the experience. ‚ÄúYou can have all the money in the world. You can have all the things in the world ‚Äì all the fancy cars, all the homes. But if you ain‚Äôt got health, you don‚Äôt have nothing,‚Äù she said. Shebyon‚Äôs family pushed her to seek better care and proved to be the catalyst in her turnaround. When she came to UCLA Health, she was introduced to 11 different specialists, all independently treating her with a variety of antibiotics and medications. Then, last year, UCLA Health launched an initiative for patients with complex conditions called the Extensivist Program, which helped Shebyon receive the comprehensive care she sought. ‚ÄúIf I had the other plan, I know I wouldn‚Äôt be here,‚Äù she said. The program brings a group of specialists together to produce a unified care plan. The team includes a primary care physician, medical oncologist, endocrinologist, urologist and students from the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. ‚ÄúWe went from fractured care, to complete care,‚Äù said Shebyon‚Äôs sister, Angela Burrell. Shebyon‚Äôs Laker For A Day experience began with what she wanted most: time with her family. Shebyon hosted a family barbecue that included Dr. Sun Yoo, her primary care physician and medical director of the Extensivist Program, and Kevin Noel, care coordinator for the Extensivist Program. As the barbecue ended, they surprised Shebyon with a custom Lakers jersey, three LeBron James jerseys for her grandchildren, and four tickets to the Lakers game against the Phoenix Suns on Dec. 2. Shebyon brought her sister, brother-in-law and her grandson Javaras, who was celebrating his birthday, to the game. The crowd reception was nothing short of amazing when Shebyon took the floor and shared her story. Javaras also competed in the Half Minute to Win It Challenge ‚Äì an on-court shooting challenge that gives a young fan a chance to earn a scholarship to Camp Lakers, presented by UCLA Health. To top it off, Shebyon met Hall of Famer Bill Russell and enjoyed a Lakers win!

In 2015, Nigel was having difficulty breathing, so his parents took him to the emergency room. Doctors discovered Nigel had a large tumor in his kidney, also known as a Wilms tumor. Doctors removed Nigel‚Äôs kidney, and he endured many round of chemotherapy following the procedure. Nigel learned his cancer had returned after tests showed he had an elevated white blood count that led to his diagnosis of leukemia, which required a bone marrow transplant; Dr. Ted Moore and his team at UCLA were on top of it. Nigel‚Äôs first match for a transplant never materialized, so Nigel‚Äôs father stepped up as a haplo match, or half match. As he recovered, Nigel was unable to attend school and lacked the energy to hang out with his friends. Luckily, he could play interactive video games where he could communicate with his friends. When asked how he processed his diagnosis, Nigel said, ‚ÄúI just try to be positive all the time and stay happy.‚Äù Nigel‚Äôs fight, determination and maturity is an inspiration to both UCLA Health and the Lakers family, earning him Laker For A Day honors. In early October, Nigel was invited to have an exclusive look at the UCLA Health Training Center: Home of the Los Angeles Lakers. The facility is where the Lakers train, practice and hang out when they are not playing games. All of the Lakers staff work out of the building as well. During the tour, Nigel and his family got to enjoy some time in the office of team owner Jeanie Buss. They were amazed by seeing their own reflection in the 10 NBA championship trophies that line the windows overlooking the practice court. As he prepared to share his story to a video crew, Nigel jokingly said: ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm getting ready to be interviewed by Bryant Gumbel.‚Äù Nigel got the full tour of the facility, from the offices to the court. The Lakers even had a special surprise for him. As Nigel walked into the players‚Äô locker room, he saw plaques above each locker that read, [Lebron] James, [Lonzo] Ball, [Kyle] Kuzma, [Rajon] Rondo ‚Ä¶ and then he saw his last name stitched on one of the jerseys! The Lakers presented Nigel with his own Lakers locker along with the custom uniform so he could truly look the part of a Laker For A Day. He raced to put on the uniform and took the court for a shootaround with his dad, Brian.

Doctors encouraged Rhianna‚Äôs parents to consider a seeing-eye dog and enroll her in a school for the blind. Her mother‚Äôs research led her to UCLA Mattel Children‚Äôs Hospital, where pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. Aria Fallah referred Rhianna for a stand-up MRI. The scan revealed a large Chiari malformation, a rare condition in which the brain slips downward and compresses the spinal column. Dr. Fallah removed Rhianna‚Äôs top vertebra and the back bone of her skull, creating more space for her brain and relieving her symptoms. When Rhianna opened her eyes after surgery, she could see again. In less than three weeks, she was living like a typical teenager: driving, working, hiking and enjoying the active social life she‚Äôd missed during her senior year.

But what if you couldn‚Äôt hear your child‚Äôs cry? That‚Äôs a challenge deaf and hearing-impaired parents live with every day, but a new app could help overcome that challenge. The ChatterBaby app not only lets deaf parents know when their baby is crying, it also can tell them why they‚Äôre crying. ‚ÄúThe app analyzes the different types of frequencies that are in the cry and the different patterns of sound and silence,‚Äù said Ariana Anderson, PhD, assistant professor in residence at the UCLA Semel Institute who spearheaded the development of the app. ‚ÄúFor example, if a cry has a long period of silence, it‚Äôs more likely that the baby is fussy. If there are constant, high-volume frequencies, it‚Äôs more likely the baby is in pain.‚Äù Anderson is a mother of four who got the idea for the app after noticing the variations of cries in her own children. She then collected a database of more than 2,000 infant cries and used machine learning to build the algorithms used in the app. ‚ÄúCurrent technology will alert parents when there is a sound coming from a child, but it doesn‚Äôt distinguish what type of sound it is,‚Äù said Anderson. ‚ÄúThis categorizes the cries to tell parents whether the baby is hungry or fussy or, with more than 90 percent accuracy, can determine if a baby is crying because it‚Äôs in pain‚Äù","ChatterBaby app,babies‚Äô cries,deaf and hearing-impaired parents,UCLA Semel Institute,baby is fussy,the baby is in pain,infant cries",28,"Science & Technology","Health,Society",PT1M51S,111,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fcxB_K611M4/maxresdefault.jpg,,,,,14311,88,,0,2

He saw his mother crying by his bedside, then began asking questions. ‚ÄúMy mom, she kind of leaned over. I said, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs wrong with my hands?‚Äô‚Äù He recalls. ‚ÄúShe said, ‚ÄòWell, they had to amputate your fingers.‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòWell, how many?‚Äô She said, ‚ÄòAll of them.‚Äô‚Äù Paulk also sustained severe burns, deforming many of his facial features. Other wounds were not as visible. But Paulk persevered, and the strength he showed in his recovery earned the former Army specialist UCLA Health Laker for a Day honors for the game against the Utah Jazz on April 8. Paulk‚Äôs injuries occurred July 5, 2007, when the tactical vehicle he was in drove over a mine. The vehicle flipped over and the fuel tank ignited, killing his team leader, ejecting Paulk and engulfing him in flames. By the time Paulk regained consciousness at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, he could barely recognize himself. His lower left eyelid drooped. His upper left eyelid and nostrils were gone. His upper lip melted upward, and his lower lip turned inside out. Both of his ears were partially amputated. ‚ÄúAt first, I didn‚Äôt really understand what happened or how badly injured I was,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt really feel any pain. And then slowly but surely, it started kicking in. And then I really kind of knew that I was in trouble.‚Äù Paulk tried to blend back into society, which proved difficult. People would stare at his injuries. Children, not knowing any better, would make comments. Paulk eventually started wearing long sleeves and a hat to try to conceal himself. ‚ÄúI was really uncomfortable with it and I started isolating myself,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when my family kind of stepped in and said you need to do something.‚Äù Paulk found his way to UCLA Operation Mend, which began in 2007 as a collaboration with the military and the Veterans Health Administration to provide free specialized care to wounded warriors and their families. He underwent cosmetic surgeries at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center that helped realign and restore his face ‚Äì and, in the process, his self-confidence. ‚ÄúThey helped me physically. That immediately helped me psychologically. I owe everything to them,‚Äù he says. Paulk is now retired and lives in his hometown of Oceanside, California. He was joined at the Lakers‚Äô game with his girlfriend Ashley. They received an up-close view of warmups and met Coach Luke Walton, and Paulk discovered he and Walton had a shared connection. Paulk bowls every week with Walton‚Äôs high school basketball coach. It‚Äôs one of several sports Paulk can partake in again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just very excited to represent the military and represent Operation Mend,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBeing a Laker for a Day is a dream come true.‚Äù Learn more at uclahealth.org/Lakers #TeamUCLALakers","UCLA Health,Lakers,#TeamUCLALakers,Team UCLA Lakers,Operation Mend",28,"Science & Technology",Sport,PT3M6S,186,2d,hd,false,,en,,,,,,580,10,,0,1

The group, known as the Ladies of the Lakers, served food to families as well as patients who were able to leave their rooms. The ladies also brought to-go boxes for families who wanted to eat in the room with their loved one. The food was provided by Petros restaurant. ‚ÄúWe wanted to do something to get the Ladies of the Lakers out into the community and give back,‚Äù says Desiree LeSassier, Player Relations Manager for the Lakers. The Ladies of the Lakers worked with Child Life Specialists to learn and understand what patients and their families experience at hospitals. Families sometimes go weeks or months without having dinners together while their child is at the hospital, often running to vending machines or making quick trips to the cafeteria, says Lisa Gronroos, Child Life Specialist at UCLA Mattel Children‚Äôs Hospital. She stresses the importance to families of socializing and eating healthy, and the opportunity to do both is what made the visit from the Ladies of the Lakers so meaningful. ‚ÄúWhen I was talking to the wives here that came to bring the dinner, it almost brought tears to my eyes because sometimes the families are forgotten,‚Äù Gronroos says. Gary McKay, whose 8-month-old son was in the hospital for spinal surgery, appreciated the ladies‚Äô efforts to take his mind off a potentially stressful situation and provide a positive reprieve in his day. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really great that the Lakers have this kind of an event because all of the families here are in a situation where their kids are in the hospital here and some of them are feeling sad,‚Äù McKay says. ‚ÄúAnd this is the kind of thing that kind of lifts your spirits.‚Äù UCLA Health and the Lakers share a commitment to building a healthier and more engaged community, celebrating sports and competition and providing the support needed for an active lifestyle.

The epileptic seizures would come on so strong and so frequently ‚Äì as many as 40 an hour ‚Äì that Gio‚Äôs parents lived in ‚Äúabsolute fear‚Äù every time the attacks began. They worried constantly about the toll the seizures were taking on their 4-year-old son and wondered whether a cure would ever come. ‚ÄúWe would ask him, ‚ÄòWhat are you feeling?‚Äô And he described it as being electrocuted,‚Äù says Ronnie, Gio‚Äôs father. What gave them comfort was the resilience and fortitude Gio often showed. He would tell his father: ‚ÄúI have epilepsy, I‚Äôm not epilepsy.‚Äù That uplifting attitude guided Gio and his family throughout their journey and earned him UCLA Health Laker for a Day honors for the game against the Miami Heat on March 16. After a series of tests in 2015, UCLA pediatric neurologist Raman Sankar discovered Gio had developed a brain abnormality in utero known as cortical dysplasia. The abnormality was located in the left frontal lobe, an operable area of the brain that would not negatively affect cognitive function, speech or motor skills. A medication regimen provided two years without seizures for Gio before ending in ‚Äúabrupt chaos,‚Äù Ronnie recalls, as the seizures returned to as many as 25 per day. The family had hoped to avoid surgery but made the difficult decision, in consultation with Dr. Sankar and the UCLA team, to pursue a procedure that would remove a portion of Gio‚Äôs brain. UCLA pediatric neurosurgeon Aria Fallah performed the seven-hour surgery at UCLA Mattel Children‚Äôs Hospital. Gio emerged from the operating room and said, ‚ÄúI love you mommy and daddy.‚Äù Four days later, the family was back home in Las Vegas with a seizure-free Gio. Gio, along with his father, mother Marie, three brothers and a family friend, returned to Los Angeles to watch the Lakers. They were treated to a behind-the-scenes tour and a VIP experience, including an in-game video montage of Gio‚Äôs journey that seemed surreal to his parents. ‚ÄúWhen you have epilepsy, you feel a constant sense of dread that something is going to break through,‚Äù Ronnie says. ‚ÄúSo a year later, to be a Laker for a Day and see him on a jumbotron, it‚Äôs unimaginable for me. I would love to think that he will look back and be like, ‚ÄòI can share my story and hopefully it will improve the lives of other people.‚Äô‚Äù For more information about pediatric epilepsy treatment, visit uclahealth.org/mattel/pediatric-neurology",,28,"Science & Technology",Sport,PT3M43S,223,2d,hd,false,,en,,,,,,837,7,,0,1

At just 3 years old, Rebecca was diagnosed with epilepsy and underwent brain surgery at UCLA Mattel Children‚Äôs Hospital. She had a second surgery when she was 8. Rebecca, who performed ballet and tap dance, had to relearn the most basic activities. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd struggle because I had to learn to walk and talk again,‚Äù she says. Rebecca, now 15, is able to enjoy her favorite hobbies, including painting, writing poetry, listening to music, reading action fantasy books, crocheting, running independent service projects, hanging out with friends, boogie boarding and dancing. She also has excelled in the classroom, earning acceptance into the National Junior Honor Society and National Honor Society. Rebecca hopes to spread more awareness about epilepsy and attend college. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very grateful to be selected Kid Captain,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúTo bring awareness to epilepsy and to educate others, it‚Äôs a big deal.

It‚Äôs just her nature to put other people first. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs always concerned about others, more concerned about others than she is herself,‚Äù says her mother, Tene. For a while, though, everyone was concerned for Summer. She was diagnosed with onset of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, which causes painful joint swelling (inflammation) and stiffness. Summer would have prolonged periods of pain that drained her energy and kept from enjoying her usual day-to-day activities. ‚ÄúI just remember being really tired and not wanting to get out of bed,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know if I was going to die or if I was going to not be able to walk again because I was in so much pain.‚Äù The painful flare-ups also left her parents exhausted and searching for answers. ‚ÄúI had no words, because I didn‚Äôt know what to do,‚Äù says her father, John. ‚ÄúAs a parent, I felt like totally helpless at the time.‚Äù Summer‚Äôs parents decided to have her care transferred to UCLA because a doctor who was instrumental in diagnosing Summer had just finished a rotation at UCLA and raved about the treatment she would receive. Her heath has improved ever since. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a total change in Summer since we‚Äôve been at UCLA,‚Äù her father says. ‚ÄúAnd as a parent, I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòYay!

The University of Maine women‚Äôs basketball coach was ultra-sensitive to noise--the sound of someone loading the dishwasher was excruciating. Even stranger, Richard began hearing his bones creak and his eyelids move. Far worse was the noise-related brain fog that descended on him inside the raucous basketball gym. He‚Äôd call a timeout during a game‚Äîonly to hear the ref blow a whistle or the band strike up a tune--and forget why he called the timeout. After his condition forced him on medical leave, Richard retreated to bed, and his wife and three children took turns tip-toing upstairs to share their day in whispers. Over a period of five months, Richard visited three prestigious medical centers and saw 15 doctors. No one knew what was wrong. Finally, a CT scan of his skull revealed a tiny opening in his ear bone and an audiologist diagnosed him with superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD). Researching SSCD online, Richard found a webinar by a UCLA Health neurosurgeon. Dr. Isaac Yang offered to review Richard‚Äôs records electronically and confirmed the SSCD diagnosis. Drawn to the minimally invasive approach that Yang pioneered with UCLA ear surgeon Dr. Quinton Gopen, Richard flew across the country for surgery at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. In the operating room, Yang made a small incision in Richard‚Äôs skull and pushed his brain out of the way, allowing Gopen to plug the miniscule hole in his ear. When Richard awoke, he was ecstatic to realize that the bizarre noises in his head had vanished and his hearing had returned. That night, his wife and he celebrated over dinner in a Los Angeles restaurant. Gopen and Yang say Richard‚Äôs frustrating journey toward diagnosis isn‚Äôt unusual. Superior canal dehiscence wasn‚Äôt identified until 1998 ‚Äì a recent enough discovery only now being added to textbooks and taught in medical school. As a result, most physicians are not familiar with the rare syndrome, which affects an estimated 1% of the population.

Nathan has loved playing basketball from a very young age, but he has also faced a serious neurological disorder for most of his life. When Nathan was 5 years old, his father passed away from epilepsy, a condition that Nathan would be diagnosed with just one year later. For several years, Nathan received medications for sudden and unpredictable seizures, but they were not working as well as hoped. In search of a more effective treatment, Nathan‚Äôs mother Johana sought help from epilepsy experts at UCLA. After being evaluated by UCLA pediatric neurosurgeons, it was determined that Nathan was a candidate for epilepsy surgery ‚Äì a procedure that would remove the area of his brain connected to his seizures. In March 2017, Nathan underwent a successful surgery and through the process became a devoted UCLA Bruins Basketball fan. Nathan has been selected as UCLA Kid Captain for his bravery and deep love of sports. ‚ÄúNathan being Kid Captain means a lot because I know how much he loves basketball and this is a big opportunity for him to express himself and go out and enjoy it,‚Äù Gongora says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably a once-in-a-lifetime experience for him.‚Äù",,28,"Science & Technology","Health,Knowledge",PT2M21S,141,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rbr9zwqHtrA/maxresdefault.jpg,,,,,212,8,,0,

Touched by an article she read about living kidney donations, Dawn decided to take action with a selfless and life-saving act of her own. On June 24, 2015, Dawn donated a kidney to a stranger experiencing renal failure. Hours after her kidney retrieval surgery at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, that stranger ‚Äî a father in the Los Angeles area ‚Äî received a second chance at life. ""I realized I had something I didn't need that someone else desperately needed,"" Dawn says. ""And I knew that if I didn't donate my kidney one day, it would probably nag at me my entire life."" The Lakers invited Dawn and Dr. Jeffrey Veale, who performed the surgery at UCLA, to a game against the Detroit Pistons at Staples Center on January 15. They were also treated to a dinner at the Lexus Club followed by a behind-the-scenes tour of Staples Center before the game. Dawn had hoped all along that a member of her recipient's family would also donate a kidney (that did not match with their loved one) to another stranger. Sure enough, inspired by her extraordinary act of kindness, the recipient's wife donated the gift of life to a young mother in Oregon the same day as Dawn's procedure. While many are motivated to donate a kidney to a friend or relative in need, Dawn recognized the struggle for strangers is just as real. She had read that wait times in California for a deceased-donor kidney could be excruciatingly long, and she knew that living-donor kidneys tended to last longer after transplant. With advances in medical technology making one of her kidneys safely available to someone who needed it to survive, Dawn refused to wait any longer. She had just completed a graduate degree and relocated to Los Angeles for her husband's job. Financial stability, a loving spouse and living a short distance from UCLA's campus and hospitals made Dawn's desire to help someone materialize quickly. ""I saw her just after she woke up and the very first thing Dawn told me was, ‚ÄòI'm really glad I did this,'"" says her husband, Chris. ""And that blew me away."" Dawn feels happy, healthy and grateful each day to be in a position to give, and she encourages others to do what they can to help someone in need. ""Chances are that in your lifetime you will know someone that has been impacted by renal failure, and you yourself might consider giving your kidney,"" Dawn says. ""And if living donation isn't for you, everyone can help solve the organ shortage by registering to become an organ donor, and you can do that today.""","living kidney donations,living kidney donation,kidney donation,ronald reagan ucla medical center,ucla health,Dr. Jeffrey Veale,deceased-donor kidney,ucla kidney exchange,kidney transplant,Los Angeles Lakers",28,"Science & Technology","Health,Knowledge",PT1M14S,74,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U-lmbbpwqoM/maxresdefault.jpg,,,,,2908,22,,0,6

For Jonathan, an entertainment executive who received a hand transplant at UCLA six months earlier, this was a made-for-TV moment even he couldn‚Äôt script. Just two years earlier, a sudden illness led to the destruction of tissue in Jonathan‚Äôs feet and hands, threatening to take his limbs ‚Äì and his life. ‚ÄúI got a text that basically said, ‚ÄòCall me. Very serious,‚Äô‚Äù recalls his wife, Jennifer. ‚ÄúI was told that he had a 90 percent chance of dying. He had multiple organ failures, and from that loss of oxygen going to his hands and feet, which in essence made his hands and feet die.‚Äù Following treatment at two out-of-state hospitals and knowing that his left hand would need amputation, Jonathan sought a rare hand transplant at UCLA. He hired a personal trainer and kept himself in peak shape to give himself the best opportunity for a successful recovery, all the while dealing with constant pain. In October 2016, at age 51, a team of surgeons led by Dr. Kodi Azari, surgical director of the UCLA Hand Transplant Program and a professor of orthopaedic surgery and plastic surgery, performed the operation to replace Jonathan‚Äôs left hand. The surgery took about 17 hours and required perfect precision to connect his nerves and tendons. ‚ÄúFunctionality came almost in flashes. One second I couldn‚Äôt do it, and then the next second I could move my thumb. And it would happen like every 10 minutes,‚Äù Jonathan says. Jonathan, a husband and father from Los Angeles, has mixed emotions because he knows none of this would have been possible without the incredible gift of the donor and their family members who agreed to make the hand available for transplantation. He remains forever grateful for the life-changing donation. As with any organ transplant, Jonathan must now take immunosuppressant medications to help prevent his body from rejecting the new hand. He also is working with occupational therapists at UCLA to improve his movement and muscle memory. Already, Jonathan has used his new hand to hold a jump rope, unscrew a bottle top and swing a tennis racquet. Jonathan‚Äôs most impressive performance since the transplant might have come before the Lakers game against Grizzlies on April 2. That‚Äôs when Jonathan showed off his healthy shooting stroke as the UCLA Health Laker for a Day. He participated in the Jr. Lakers Shooting Contest, helping a lucky young fan win a scholarship to the camp this summer. ‚ÄúJust watching him with his first shot swish a basket really means the world to me,‚Äù says Dr. Azari, who joined Jonathan and his friends at the game. Even for someone who has helped bring many reality shows to TV, Jonathan‚Äôs journey has been quite the Hollywood story ‚Äì and he looks forward to sharing it more in hopes of inspiring others. ‚ÄúBeing Laker for the Day means the world to me,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBecause it means the world has the opportunity not only to experience what‚Äôs possible in this medical miracle, but also what‚Äôs possible within themselves to do whatever it is to do what they set out to do.‚Äù","hand transplant,ucla hand transplant,ucla hand transplantation,multiple organ failures,amputation,Dr. Kodi Azari,UCLA Hand Transplant Program,immunosuppressant medication,occupational therapists,Laker for the Day",28,"Science & Technology","Health,Society,Television_program",PT4M39S,279,2d,hd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/phvRCI_hm2E/maxresdefault.jpg,,,,,23338,278,,0,23

Except Walter's life started out anything but normal. Walter was born with only one ventricle in his heart, so instead of two ventricles pumping blood ‚Äì one to the lungs, another to the body ‚Äì he has just one to the body. Thanks to doctors at UCLA Health, however, Walter was able to undergo a procedure that allows him to lead a relatively normal life. ""The surgery essentially linked his veins up with his pulmonary arteries,"" says Dr. Jamil Aboulhosn, director of the UCLA Adult Congenital Heart Disease Program. Walter enjoys spending time with his two charismatic daughters, 7-year-old Samantha and 8-year-old Danielle, who infuse energy and enthusiasm into his daily activities. That was especially evident during their behind-the-scenes tour of Staples Center, where they were treated to dinner in the Chairman's Lounge and had an opportunity to meet and mingle with Lakers co-owner Jeanie Buss before the Valentine's Day game against Sacramento. ""What keeps me going is I have my two daughters,"" Walter says. ""I take care of myself so I can provide for them.

So, as a lifelong Lakers fan, of course nothing would prevent him from enjoying a behind-the-scenes game experience as the UCLA Health Laker for a Day. Doctors diagnosed Julian with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, an aggressive form of blood cancer, in January 2016. He has been receiving treatment at UCLA Mattel Children‚Äôs Hospital ever since, undergoing chemotherapy, blood and platelet transfusions, diagnostic imaging and other treatment procedures, including spinal taps and bone marrow biopsies. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a journey,‚Äù says Julian, now 16. Julian has been unable to attend school regularly due to a weakened immune system from the treatment. That often means restricting visitors at his home to protect his health. ‚ÄúThe toughest thing about it is not being able to really do anything about it and just hoping, hoping, that he does not get discouraged,‚Äù says his father, Ron, who joined Julian at the Lakers game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on March 24th. Julian attended games as a youngster with his father, so coming back to STAPLES Center was a symbolic way to celebrate the strength and determination he has displayed throughout his recovery. He toured the Chairman‚Äôs Lounge, met Lakers co-owner Jeanie Buss and watched pregame warm-ups courtside before being recognized during a halftime presentation.

ALL, the most common cancer among children, is a fast-growing form of leukemia that requires aggressive treatment. Rey was cared for at an outside hospital for two years, undergoing weekly outpatient chemotherapy infusions, numerous procedures and a daily oral medication regimen.

The research focused on the structure and function of dendrites, which are components of neurons, the nerve cells in the brain. Neurons are typically tree-like structures made up of a body, the soma, with numerous branches called dendrites extending outward. Somas generate brief electrical pulses called ‚Äúspikes‚Äù in order to connect and communicate with each other. The spikes activate the dendrites, which passively send currents to other neurons‚Äô soma. This process is the basis for how memories are formed and stored. Scientists have believed that this was dendrites‚Äô primary role. But a UCLA team led by UCLA neurophysicist Mayank Mehta discovered that dendrites are not just passive conduits. Their research showed that dendrites are electrically active in animals that are moving around freely, generating nearly 10 times more spikes than somas. The finding challenges the long-held belief that spikes in the soma are the primary way in which perception, learning and memory formation occur. The video shows a neuron with extensive, branch-like dendrites. The blue trace near the bottom shows the neuron's cell body firing spikes. The electrodes (golden rods) approach a dendritic branch (red) from the top. The dendrite and electrode are engulfed by protective glial cells (green and blue) that allows the measurement of dendritic spikes (red trace) without harming the dendrite. There are nearly ten times as many dendritic spikes (red) as somatic spikes (blue).","study,UCLA study,brain,how the brain works,neurological disorders,dendrites,nerve cells in the brain,neurons,electrical pulses called ‚Äúspikes‚Äù,neurons‚Äô soma,neural tissue,UCLA neurophysicist Mayank Mehta,Mayank Mehta,brain-like computers",28,"Science & Technology","Health,Knowledge",PT40S,40,2d,sd,false,,en,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iCtwWBklJ8g/maxresdefault.jpg,,,,,5483,24,,0,0

There are now nearly 2.5 million people living with congenital heart defect in the U.S., more than half of which are adults. That represents an increase of 63 percent just since 2000. Now, women born with heart defects want babies of their own. In the past, medical experts discouraged this, but Mary M. Canobbio, RN, MN, FAAN, a nurse at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and lecturer at the UCLA School of Nursing, helped develop new recommendations that are giving women hope. These guidelines were recently published in the American Heart Association journal Circulation. ‚ÄúThis really represents a shift in thinking and offers new hope for a growing segment of our society,‚Äù said Canobbio. The recommendations suggest women undergo extensive preconception testing and counseling. If doctors determine a woman can safely delivery a baby, the recommendations say, she should work with a team of specialists, including a cardiologist and an obstetrician or gynecologist trained in high-risk pregnancies. They also recommend that women deliver at a large medical center that has sufficient staff and resources to respond to any medical emergencies that might arise. After delivery, the recommendations suggest, doctors should closely follow a woman‚Äôs heart function for at least six weeks, and in some cases up to six months, to check for any long-term damage that may have occurred as a result of the pregnancy.

An incurable disease, pulmonary fibrosis, was causing his lungs to turn to hardened scar tissue, and he was permanently tethered to an oxygen tank. His only hope was a double lung transplant. In November 2012, he got an early-morning call that a pair of donor lungs was available. Upon arriving at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, he was told of a new study testing an experimental device ‚Äî a portable organ-preservation system that keeps donor lungs functioning and ""breathing"" in a near-physiologic state outside the body during transport to a recipient, instead of the standard method, in which the organs are kept in an icebox in a non-functioning, non-breathing state. Padilla consented to participate in the study and was randomized to become the first patient at UCLA ‚Äî and in the United States ‚Äî to undergo the 'breathing lung' transplant using the TransMedics Organ Care System (OCS). ""If they've got new technology to deliver the lungs still breathing, I think that would be better than trying to wake them back up again after being on ice,"" said the former construction worker, who had helped build the very same hospital where he was now a patient. ""I'm just following technology.""

The tumor arises in the vestibular nerve, which is involved in balance, and therefore the proper name is a vestibular schwannoma. These tumors are typically benign. People with Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF-2) commonly have acoustic neuromas. Because the treatment of acoustic neuromas is rarely urgent, patients should strongly consider obtaining second opinions prior to undergoing treatment. The chances of a good outcome are increased at larger centers treating a high volume of acoustic neuroma patients.

Trauma to the spinal cord is commonly associated with damage to the spine itself. Often, a fracture of the spine occurs in relation to the injured central nervous system tissue. The area where the spinal cord is injured dictates the level of function, as dysfunction develops below that specific level. Spinal cord injuries are classified as either incomplete or complete. Incomplete injuries show preservation of some function below the injured level. Complete injuries are characterized by a total lack of both motor and sensory function in motor-sensory and electrical modalities below the level of the injury.

""I want these young men and women to look their very, very best. If we continue to see improvement with each operation, then we will go as long as necessary to get the best result we can,"" Miller said. Currently, there are nine soldiers in the ""Operation Mend"" program.

Dr. Dennis Woo, a pediatrician at UCLA Health Santa Monica, has been fielding calls from worried parents. ‚ÄúI am convinced that most people make this decision not based on fact but on feeling.‚Äù Dr. Woo said, adding those feelings are influenced by what parents have heard from friends. Carrie Swearngin, mother of a two year old boy, said she has friends who urged her not to vaccinate her son Samuel. ‚ÄúThey were in our ear about it a little bit,‚Äù she said. Friendly advice aside, what does the scientific evidence actually show about the safety of the MMR vaccine? ‚ÄúFacts are that many studies have been done to look at the safety of vaccines, and they're looking at large populations of children and it‚Äôs been determined that‚Ä¶ autism is not caused by the MMR.‚Äù Dr. Woo said. The American Academy of Pediatrics has a detailed list of those studies with links to the published results. Among them, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) conducted a study comparing rates of vaccination among thousands of children, some of whom had autism, and others who didn‚Äôt have autism. The study found similar rates of vaccination between the two groups. Other studies have looked at the effects of thimerosal (mercury), a vaccine preservative that some parents believed caused autism. A scientific review by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found no connection between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. Nevertheless, in 2001 thimerosal was removed or reduced to trace amounts in all childhood vaccines except for one type of influenza vaccine, for which alternatives without thimerosal are available upon request. ‚ÄúWe effectively have removed mercury or thimerosal from all the children‚Äôs vaccines and we have not seen any drop in autism. So clearly, autism is not caused by thimerosal,‚Äù Dr. Woo said. Other parents voice a concern about kids getting too many vaccines at once, and whether all of them are needed. A 2013 study published in the Journal of Pediatrics looked at this concern of ‚Äútoo many vaccines too soon.‚Äù The study examined the medical records of about a thousand children, how many vaccines they got, and found no connection between the number of vaccines they got, and whether they developed autism. Researchers also note that the amount of antigens (immune stimulating material) in modern vaccines is much lower than those in older vaccines used in the 1990‚Äôs. ‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs immune systems are well suited to be able to tolerate all that,‚Äù Dr. Woo said. The MMR and autism scare was sparked by a 1998 study by British surgeon Dr. Andrew Wakefield, which linked the MMR vaccine to autism. The study involved only 12 children. The British Medical Journal launched an investigation into the study and found numerous problems in the way it was conducted. It also found that Wakefield was paid $600,000 by lawyers trying to sue vaccine manufacturers. Ten of the 13 author withdrew their support for the study‚Äôs conclusions. In 2010, the medical journal Lancet completely retracted the study. A British medical panel concluded that Dr. Wakefield had been dishonest, and violated basic research ethics rules. British regulators revoked his medical license, saying he was guilty of ‚Äúserious professional misconduct.‚Äù After weighing the evidence, Swearngin went ahead and got her son vaccinated. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs all set,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre of the mind frame to listen to the doctor.‚Äù The current MMR recommendation is that children get the first shot at 12-15 months of age, and the second shot between 4-6 years of age. Dr. Woo said that if your child is up to date on the first MMR shot, there is no need to get the second shot early, unless there was a known exposure to measles.

Then he added a twist. Each time someone waved to him as he passed, he would respond with a wave, and donate 25 cents from his disability checks to Operation Mend, UCLA's program to provide medical services to soldiers disfigured by war in Iraq and Afghanistan. The people in the rural California town of Murphys, where Ryan and his wife live, took notice, and soon they began to open their own wallets. What began as a trickle of donations became a flood, and in three years Ryan raised more than $48,000 in contributions - while donating another $19,000 himself. Now the 68-year-old Marine Corps vet known as the Walking Man of Murphy took another walk, this time in New York City on November 11, with the UCLA Operation Mend team in the America's Parade, which is the oldest and largest event in the United States honoring the men and women who have defended the country's freedoms.

She was wrong. She was having a stroke. The numbness recurred off and on for several days. Then one night she had a piercing headache, an uncommon event for her.

After a battery of tests, Reilly was diagnosed with Moyamoya disease - a rare, progressive cerebrovascular disorder caused by blocked arteries at the base of the brain, cutting off blood flow. One of the first symptoms of Moyamoya is recurrent transient ischemic attacks, or TIAs, commonly referred to as ‚Äúmini-strokes,‚Äù exactly what Reilly was experiencing. She had no idea the danger she was in, Liebeskind said. ‚ÄúThe worst and a very likely possibility is that she would have had a significant stroke,‚Äù he said, one that could have been extremely debilitating or even fatal.

The drug, Keytruda, was tested on more than 600 patients who had melanoma that had spread throughout their bodies. Because so many of the patients in the early testing showed significant long-lasting responses, the study was continued and the FDA granted the drug ‚Äúbreakthrough therapy‚Äù status, allowing it to be fast-tracked for approval. The largest Phase 1 study in the history of oncology, the research was conducted at UCLA and 11 other sites in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Keytruda, formerly known as MK-3475, is an antibody that targets a protein called PD-1 that is expressed by immune cells. The protein puts the immune system‚Äôs brakes on, keeping its T cells from recognizing and attacking cancer cells, said Dr. Antoni Ribas, the study‚Äôs principal investigator and a professor of medicine in the division of hematology‚Äìoncology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.

For nine months, Karrie Aitken, 46, couldn't tolerate any sound, including her own voice. Each word vibrated in her head like she was trapped inside a barrel. Munching on chips was deafening. But hearing her heartbeat was the worst. ""My heart pounded like a drum in my ear 24/7,"" described the Chatsworth mother of three. ""It drowned out music, television and a roomful of people talking. I had to take anxiety pills to fall asleep; the noise never went away."" Karrie's bizarre auditory symptoms were accompanied by hearing loss, ear pain, poor balance, vertigo and nausea. Multiple trips to the E.R. and various physicians proved fruitless. Doctors advised her to get a hearing aid and see a psychiatrist, and blamed her symptoms on sinusitis and anxiety attacks. Depression consumed Karrie's life; she lost 40 pounds and cried constantly. Finally she was examined at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center by head and neck surgeon Dr. Quinton Gopen. He told her, ""I know what you have."" Aitken suffered from a rare disease called superior semicircular canal dehiscence, caused by a tiny hole in one of the three canals inside her left ear. A CT scan revealed that the bone separating the superior canal from the brain had thinned, opening a small pore between the two areas that broadcast sounds from Karrie's body directly into her inner ear. Gopen partnered with UCLA neurosurgeon Dr. Isaac Yang to open Karrie's skull, push the brain out of the way and plug the miniscule hole in her ear canal. When Karrie awoke, the loud echoes of her heartbeat and voice had vanished. Her hearing is good as new, and she has regained her appetite and enthusiasm for life. According to Dr. Gopen, Karrie's frustrating journey toward diagnosis isn't unusual. Superior canal dehiscence wasn't identified until 1998 -- a recent enough discovery that it's just beginning to be added to textbooks and taught in medical school. As a result, Dr. Gopen says, most physicians are not familiar with the rare syndrome, which affects an estimated 1% of the population. Dr. Yang and Dr. Gopen recently published the first overview on SCD in last month's Journal of Neurological Surgery. Their goal is to educate their colleagues so other patients don't have to suffer Karrie's ordeal, and to share the best way to uncover the ear-canal hole -- typically the width of three human hairs.","Dr. Quinton Gopen,head and neck surgery at ucla,Dr. Isaac Yang,UCLA Neurosurgery",28,"Science & Technology","Health,Knowledge",PT3M56S,236,2d,sd,false,,,,,,,,1837,16,,0,3

It happened to Landon Jones when he was 15 months old. He was walking around eating a handful of nuts when a cashew became lodged in his bronchi (wind passage to his lung) causing wheezing and coughing. ‚ÄúAt the time, Landon had a cold so it was not obvious if the coughing was related to his illness or choking,‚Äù recalled his mother, Ula Jones. Eventually, the nut in his bronchi was detected by his doctor and had to be removed in a delicate surgery under anesthesia. Thankfully, the toddler made a full recovery. ‚ÄúLandon's situation is surprisingly common,‚Äù explained Landon‚Äôs surgeon, Dr. Nina Shapiro, a professor of head and neck surgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. ‚ÄúIn many kids, the food object passes down to their bronchi where it gets lodged and they present with coughing, wheezing, or even what might appear to be pneumonia. At first, it is not always clear that the child has had a choking incident.‚Äù Read more at http://ucla.in/1uBeqZc","Child (Literature Subject),Children,Choking Hazards,Nina Shapiro MD,Choking (Disease Or Medical Condition),UCLA Health",28,"Science & Technology",Health,PT1M57S,117,2d,hd,false,,,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tQlyJl2S9rs/maxresdefault.jpg,,,,,8756,31,,0,1

""We wanted a small, minimally invasive procedure,"" she explains. ""And we were searching and we found and came across UCLA."" They came to the UCLA Department of Urology where they met surgeon and urologist Jim Hu, MD. With careful examination and imaging, Dr. Hu assessed Alex.

Greenwald, age 58, who has no history of colon cancer in his family, thought that removing a section of his colon containing the polyp sounded drastic. Especially since only 15 percent of all polyps turn out to be malignant, according to UCLA experts. He looked for an alternative and found that a UCLA team of surgeons and gastroenterologists have been performing a new minimally-invasive procedure to remove large polyps in hard-to-reach places while keeping the colon intact. The procedure, called CELS, combines two minimally invasive techniques -- endoscopy and laparoscopic surgery. Currently, it has only been performed at a handful of medical centers in the United States. ""With the advent of new technology, we have the ability to develop new techniques like CELS to help address more individual needs of patients, "" said Dr. Anne Lin, assistant professor-in-residence of general surgery for the UCLA Health System and David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. ""The approach may prove to be a viable option for patients like Mr. Greenwald."" The new technique starts out like a colonoscopy, with a gastroenterologist advancing an endoscope inside the colon. The endoscope, a device with a small video camera and a light attached, lets doctors look inside the body cavity. Once a polyp is in sight and the gastroenterologist is ready to remove it, the surgeon uses minimally invasive surgical tools, inserted through two to four tiny incisions in the abdomen, to carefully maneuver and manipulate the colon, allowing the gastroenterologist better access to the polyp. Greenwald's two centimeter- sized polyp was in a tricky location, in the juncture of the small and large intestine. The surgical team gently maneuvered Greenwald's colon to allow UCLA gastroenterologist Dr. Kevin Ghassemi, better access to remove it. Once the polyp was removed, it was immediately taken to the lab for analysis to determine if it was benign or cancerous, while the team and patient waited in the operating room. The analysis takes about 30 minutes. If the polyp turns out to be cancerous, the team proceeds with standard surgery to remove the affected portion of the colon. Much to Greenwald's relief, his polyp turned out to be benign. The two-hour procedure went smoothly and he was discharged later that day. ""I couldn't believe how easy it was,"" said Greenwald. ""I feel like it was quick and efficient. I had the procedure in the morning and was out by the afternoon with no discomfort,"" said Greenwald, a software quality engineer who is married with two sons. He even walked around the UCLA campus the next day and was back playing tennis the following week. ""The CELS procedure demonstrates an important collaboration between the gastroenterology and surgery departments that can help us offer more minimally invasive options to patients,"" said Ghassemi, an assistant professor in the division of digestive diseases at the UCLA Health System and the Geffen School of Medicine. As for Greenwald, he hasn't missed a beat. He is now a strong proponent of the importance of receiving a routine colonoscopy. He has even encouraged other family members to have the preventive procedure. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related death.

UCLA's nurse-midwives care for thousands of patients and attend nearly 450 births each year as part of the UCLA obstetrics group. Certified nurse-midwives [CNMs] are professionals who earn a master's degree in nursing, complete an accredited midwifery education program and pass a national certification examination. The scope of practice for CNMs includes well-woman gynecology and family planning as well as pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum and early newborn care. In providing care for women with low-risk pregnancies, they focus on health promotion, individualized wellness education and planning for labor and birth. At UCLA, their close collaboration with obstetricians and anesthesiologists ensures that any women who experience complications or desire pain medication have easy and quick access to the medical team. UCLA's certified nurse-midwives also provide a valuable service by educating the next generation of UCLA-trained obstetricians in strategies that support holistic care and the natural childbirth process.

When a CT scan revealed a 24-inch clot stretching from his legs into his heart, doctors feared the mass could break loose and lodge in his lungs, blocking oxygen and killing him instantly. Dr. John Moriarty gave his patient a choice. Dunlap could have open-heart surgery or undergo a new minimally invasive procedure using a device called AngioVac to vacuum the massive clot out of his heart. The catch? The procedure had never been successfully performed in California. A new grandfather, Dunlap didn't hesitate to choose the second option and underwent the procedure on Aug. 14. A week later, he was home, full of energy and eager to play on the floor with his 9-month-old grandson. Here's how it worked: A team of UCLA interventional radiologists and cardiovascular surgeons slid a tiny camera down Dunlap's esophagus to visually monitor his heart. Next, they guided a coiled hose through his neck artery and plugged one end into his heart, against the clot. They threaded the other end through a vein at the groin and hooked the hose up to a powerful heart-bypass device in the operating room to create suction. ""Once in place, the AngioVac quickly sucked the deadly clot out of Mr. Dunlap's heart and filtered out the solid tissue,"" said Moriarty, a UCLA interventional radiologist with expertise in clot removal and cardiovascular imaging. ""The system then restored the cleansed blood through a blood vessel near the groin, eliminating the need for a blood transfusion.""

He will also play guitar in public for the first time since the May 23 surgery. Carter chose to undergo the surgery to halt what is known as benign essential tremor, a neurological disorder that made his hands shake when he moved them. He was the 500th Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center patient to undergo the deep-brain stimulation procedure, which uses imaging technology to target the exact site in the brain producing abnormal electrical signals. When surgeons implant the pacemaker, they stimulate the region to restore a more normal pattern of brain activity, effectively stopping the tremors.

The condition is most common among women and older adults, but obesity, standing on the job, personal or family history of venous disease, and hormonal changes before and after pregnancy increase the risk for developing varicose veins. Peter Lawrence, M.D., director of UCLA's Gonda (Goldschmied) Vascular Center, notes that it is important for patients to be evaluated and treated by an expert in venous disease. ""There are many new approaches to varicose veins and venous insufficiency. To prevent recurrence, a comprehensive approach is needed,"" he notes. ""It's not just a cosmetic problem,"" says Cheryl Hoffman, M.D., medical director of UCLA's Imaging and Interventional Center in Manhattan Beach, who treats superficial varicose veins using minimally invasive techniques. ""Varicose veins can be painful."" The condition occurs when valves that facilitate blood flow between the heart and the legs begin to leak and cause blood to pool in the legs. Common symptoms include leg swelling, muscle cramps, soreness, tiredness and aching in the legs, itchiness around the vein, skin discoloration and ulcers. ""Once those superficial veins stop working, they really aren't needed,"" she says. ""In most cases, we can easily close off problem veins using a catheter to direct laser or radiofrequency energy to heat the inside the blood vessels."" Ultrasound is used to extensively map the vein physiology and blood flow and to guide the procedure. Unlike more invasive approaches, this technique, called endovenous thermal ablation, causes less pain, bleeding and bruising and enables patients to return to normal activities faster.

For nine months, Karrie Aitken, 46, couldn't tolerate any sound, including her own voice. Each word vibrated in her head like she was trapped inside a barrel. Munching on chips was deafening. But hearing her heartbeat was the worst. ""My heart pounded like a drum in my ear 24/7,"" described the Chatsworth mother of three. ""It drowned out music, television and a roomful of people talking. I had to take anxiety pills to fall asleep; the noise never went away."" Karrie's bizarre auditory symptoms were accompanied by hearing loss, ear pain, poor balance, vertigo and nausea. Multiple trips to the E.R. and various physicians proved fruitless. Doctors advised her to get a hearing aid and see a psychiatrist, and blamed her symptoms on sinusitis and anxiety attacks. Depression consumed Karrie's life; she lost 40 pounds and cried constantly. Finally she was examined at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center by head and neck surgeon Dr. Quinton Gopen. He told her, ""I know what you have."" Aitken suffered from a rare disease called superior semicircular canal dehiscence, caused by a tiny hole in one of the three canals inside her left ear. A CT scan revealed that the bone separating the superior canal from the brain had thinned, opening a small pore between the two areas that broadcast sounds from Karrie's body directly into her inner ear. Gopen partnered with UCLA neurosurgeon Dr. Isaac Yang to open Karrie's skull, push the brain out of the way and plug the miniscule hole in her ear canal. When Karrie awoke, the loud echoes of her heartbeat and voice had vanished. Her hearing is good as new, and she has regained her appetite and enthusiasm for life. According to Dr. Gopen, Karrie's frustrating journey toward diagnosis isn't unusual. Superior canal dehiscence wasn't identified until 1998 -- a recent enough discovery that it's just beginning to be added to textbooks and taught in medical school. As a result, Dr. Gopen says, most physicians are not familiar with the rare syndrome, which affects an estimated 1% of the population. Dr. Yang and Dr. Gopen recently published the first overview on SCD in last month's Journal of Neurological Surgery. Their goal is to educate their colleagues so other patients don't have to suffer Karrie's ordeal, and to share the best way to uncover the ear-canal hole -- typically the width of three human hairs.

Now that same technology is being used to deliver ""breathing lungs."" The lung transplant team at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical successfully performed the nation's first ""breathing lung"" transplant in mid-November. The patient, a 57-year-old who suffered from pulmonary fibrosis ‚Äî a disease in which the air sacs of the lungs are gradually replaced by scar tissue ‚Äî is recuperating from the seven-hour surgery. The groundbreaking transplant involved an experimental organ-preservation device known as the Organ Care System (OCS), which keeps donor lungs functioning and ""breathing"" in a near-physiologic state outside the body during transport. The current standard involves transporting donor lungs in a non-functioning, non-breathing state inside an icebox.

She asked doctors to delay telling her the results of their tests, and it wasn't until shortly after daughter Ella's birth that Edna learned she had breast cancer. Receiving the news she had cancer so soon after the birth of her child was a shock. ""I just remember thinking, 'Oh, what if I'm not around?'"" Edna says. She turned for help to the Revlon/UCLA Breast Center. There, the specialists who would be involved in her care -- from the radiologist who would read her scans and the pathologist who would review her slides to the medical radiation oncologist and breast surgeon -- work within close walking distance to each other, easing the burden on patients who must be seen by many different specialists during the course of their treatment. Edna and her medical team opted for removal of both her breasts, followed immediately by reconstruction using a flap of Edna's own abdominal tissue. ""We had to remove the cancer, but at the same time reconstruct her [to] avoid the sense of loss for her as far as her body image,"" says plastic and reconstructive surgeon Jaco Festekjian, M.D. ""The most aesthetic and good-looking outcomes are the ones that are done immediately at the time of the mastectomy."" For Edna, the entire experience was something of a ""whirlwind,"" but she says the care and compassion she received at the Breast Center helped to guide her to the decisions that were right for her. ""When I think of my hopes and dreams for our family, I just know I'll be around that long,"" she says. http://breastcenter.ucla.edu/westwood","breast cancer,revlon,ucla breast center,westwood,Dr. John Glaspy,Dr. Raquel Prati,Dr. Jaco Festekjian,mastectomy",28,"Science & Technology","Health,Knowledge",PT4M24S,264,2d,sd,false,,,,,,,,1960,4,,0,0

The transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for appropriate patients with aortic valve stenosis who are not candidates for open surgery to replace their natural aortic valve. The procedure resembles a balloon angioplasty, in which a catheter - a long, flexible tube - is threaded through an artery and a balloon device on the end inflates to help open up a narrowing in an artery in the heart. In the case of TAVR, the replacement valve collapses to a very small diameter and is crimped onto the balloon device. The surgeon positions the replacement valve inside the patient's natural aortic valve and inflates the balloon. This causes the replacement valve to expand, pushing the faulty valve aside. The replacement valve begins to function as soon as the balloon catheter deflates to permit the flow of blood.

Lying in her hospital bed at UCLA, the seriously ill cystic fibrosis patient felt herself slipping away and her life flashing by. But then the image of her husband appeared, and she knew she was not ready to go. A series of dramatic medical ups and downs had Schmidt ""on"" the transplant list, then ""off"" the list. At one point, her right lung stopped functioning, her left lung only partially worked and a machine that provided oxygen had to be dialed up to 100 percent. Twice, when her tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation was insufficient to provide enough oxygen, she was put on a last-ditch life-support system called extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, which took over her breathing function through a cannula surgically placed in her neck. But she would not give up. In fact, while on ECMO and attached to a tower of medicine lines and pumps, she was able to get up and walk. Traditionally, patients on ECMO are sedated and immobile, but a new innovative ambulatory ECMO approach has been shown to help certain patients gain strength and muscle mass in preparation for surgery. With this new ""bridge"" approach, Schmidt was not sedated but alert and able to walk, which helped keep her well enough for transplant surgery. She was also working hard to gain weight and fight off various disease-related infections. But despite her determination, her condition was declining and time was running out. ""Meara's tenaciousness and her sufficient recovery from ECMO convinced us that we should still pursue transplantation,"" said Dr. David Ross, a professor of pulmonology and medical director of the UCLA Lung Transplant Program. ""I seldom witness 'miracles of medicine,' but shortly after she was listed again on the active transplant list, the perfect pair of donor lungs became available.""

But just weeks after bringing Alexandria home, John and Andrea began to suspect something was wrong. At her two-month checkup, Alexandra wasn't moving her arms and legs and she was breathing rapidly. Alexandria was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). ""Spinal Muscular Atrophy is an illness caused by an abnormal copy of a gene from mom and dad, passed onto the baby. This disease gets worse and worse, and over time, will be fatal for the majority of those infected,"" explains Mousa Shamonki, M.D., director, In Vitro Fertilization and Assisted Reproduction at UCLA. During 12 days in the hospital, Alexandria slowly deteriorated and she passed away on New Years Day 2008. When John and Andrea were ready to expand their family a few years later, they sought the help of Dr. Shamonki. They had heard how using in vitro fertilization, and the latest reproductive testing and technology, Dr. Shamonki and his team would be able to extract sperm and eggs to implant healthy embryos into mothers. ""We were fortunate to hear about this option and basically, what it allows you to do is to test the embryos for this genetic disease before they are implanted into the uterus. So before you are pregnant, you can test it to see if the baby is, in fact, affected with the disease,"" says Andrea. ""We practice at the cutting edge of medicine to provide the best of care for each and every patient. We treat each patient as an individual. Everyone has a unique story, so our goal is to discover how we can best treat that individual to achieve their goals of having a child,"" Dr. Shamonki says. The procedure was successful. John and Andrea are blessed with healthy twins, Calla and Isabella. ""When the babies came out, John was there, in the operating room, and [the nurses] literally were like, baby A, baby B. I just started crying and I couldn't believe it, I was just in shock. I just thought, wow, we are so lucky, we are so blessed that they are here, and that they are healthy,"" Andrea says. ""There's great science, and then there's great care. What we found at UCLA was that the two were merged,"" John says. ""I was just so happy. Honestly, I had forgotten what it felt like to be that happy,"" Andrea exclaims.

The force of the impact broke the 22-year-old student's neck. As a result of the accident, Daniela was left a quadriplegic, unable to use her legs and with limited use of her arms and hands. Daniela has spent the past three years fighting against her injury to regain independence. One of the major obstacles she faced was lack of bladder control and her inability to manage a normally placed catheter. ""Bladder management was the one thing that was really getting in the way of my said independence,"" Daniela says. ""I had to catheterize five times a day ... but somebody else had to do it for me. And it was just a complete invasion of privacy, and I had to time my days around when I had to go to the bathroom."" To address Daniela's problem, UCLA urologist Ja-Hong Kim, M.D., performed surgery to essentially reconstruct the young woman's bladder. Using a piece of Daniela's intestines, Dr. Kim constructed a patch of living fabric to expand the bladder, giving it more capacity. She then re-purposed Daniela's pipe-shaped appendix to route the urine to the outside, in a location she could reach to catheterize. And she did something extra. ""Rather than connecting the bladder and the appendix to the skin where it would be noticeable, we decided to connect it to her belly button, and hide it,"" Dr. Kim says. Since the surgery, Daniela can now imagine such things as returning to school, having a job, dating again, ""and just have as fulfilling and normal a life as possible."" ""We're quite pleased with how everything worked out,"" Dr. Kim says. Says Daniela: ""My greatest hope is to maintain my adventurous spirit. I don't want to be limited by my spinal-cord injury. I'm okay with dealing with it now. It's a difficult part of my life, but I don't want that to stop me.""

This year, four students at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA decided to try something new to defuse the tension. With the administration's blessing, a flash mob of 50 people disrupted the Match Day ceremony by spontaneously joining a dance choreographed to Chris Brown's pulsating ""3xYeah."" Caught by surprise as the students started to dance, everyone stood up, and hundreds of cameras and cell phones captured the spectacle with thunderous approval. The loudest cheers were saved for the end, when senior associate dean Dr. Neil Parker and student-affairs director Meredith Szumski stepped to the front of the flash mob and exhibited their enthusiastic dance moves. Medical students Justin Hayase, Mitra Nejad, Alyssa Scott and Lissa Yu secretly planned the performance since January. Yu thought up the idea, Scott recruited the student-affairs staff, and Nejad reached out to classmates. A competitive hip-hop dancer, Hayase created the choreography and posted private videos on YouTube to teach the routine to classmates and student-affairs staff. About a third of the fourth-year class took part in the high-energy dance, which climaxed in the UCLA eight-clap and cheers.

Almost half of people age 85 and older will be stricken. Moreover, the burden of dementia is even higher as Alzheimer's disease accounts only for 60 to 80 percent of cases of dementia. And as devastating as these disorders are to those afflicted, the illnesses also have a tremendous impact on the people in those patients' lives‚Äîfamily members, friends and caregivers. To that end, UCLA is launching the new UCLA Alzheimer's and Dementia Care program that will provide comprehensive, coordinated care, resources and support to patients and their caregivers, who are often family members. Patti Davis, daughter of President Reagan and a long-time advocate in the fight against the disease, will be an integral member of the program. With Linda Ercoli, director of geriatric psychology in the UCLA Division of Geriatric Psychiatry, Davis will co-lead support groups for families affected by the disease‚Äîsomething with which she is all too familiar. ""It's a role I'm familiar with because my family went through a decade of my father's illness under the glare of the public spotlight,"" Davis said. ""The program of support groups will do a lot to ease the loneliness and fear that comes with being in a family with Alzheimer's."" The UCLA Alzheimer's and Dementia Care program will have three main components: creation of a dementia registry; a needs assessment of patients listed in the registry; and individualized dementia care plans based on those assessments.","UCLA,Alzheimer's Disease,Dementia care,Pattie Davis,Dr. David Reuben,Linda Ercoli,UCLA Geriatrics,geriatric psychiatry",28,"Science & Technology","Health,Society,Television_program",PT3M24S,204,2d,sd,false,,,,,,,,3215,9,,0,5

No combination of drugs or physical therapy helped, and to try to ease his pain Jonathan started dropping his head low, resting his chin on his chest.

""Many procedures that were once the domain of the surgeon can now be done in a more minimally invasive way,"" says V. Raman Muthusamy, M.D. (http://uclahealth.org/RamanMuthusamy), associate clinical professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and director of interventional endoscopy, a newly created position within UCLA Health System that reflects the field's emergence. An endoscope is a long fiber-optic tube with a camera and a light at its tip, along with a small channel through which gastroenterologists pass instruments into the gut to perform a variety of treatments while viewing images on a monitor. ""Through the endoscope, we can now perform biopsies, cut things, cauterize and even seal up small holes,"" explains Dr. Muthusamy. Some early-stage cancers and polyps that would have previously required surgical removal can now be treated endoscopically, he notes. In some advanced cancers stents can relieve obstructions for patients with tumors blocking the gastrointestinal tract. Interventional endoscopists are accessing the bile duct and pancreas to remove gallstones or overcome obstructions that might otherwise require surgical exploration. For patients with Barrett's esophagus with dysplasia -- early changes in cells that can signal cancer -- the first-line therapy now involves use of endoscopic techniques to burn away the affected cells and prevent the development of cancer and the need for surgery. Endoscopy is also being used to treat other gastrointestinal disorders. With endoscopic ultrasound -- a procedure that combines endoscopy with ultrasound imaging to create more detailed pictures -- a patient suspected of having a pancreatic tumor, for example, can be diagnosed and biopsied, the tumor can be staged, and the nerves can be injected through the endoscope to relieve pain. UCLA has also begun to use endoscopy to improve the results of bariatric weight-loss surgery. Many patients who have gastric bypass operations begin to regain weight over time, often because the pouch created to restrict food intake stretches. Interventional endoscopist Rabindra Watson, M.D., has been involved in the development of techniques that improve the surgical outcome by reducing the volume of the pouch endoscopically. Dr. Watson is also conducting research toward the goal of using endoscopy to perform the weight-loss surgery itself. He is the first of several additional interventional endoscopists who will join the program. ""Endoscopy represents the continuation of a natural progression from open surgery to minimally invasive laparoscopic techniques, to something even less invasive that has also been shown to be safe and effective, as well as reversible,"" Dr. Watson says. ""This is the future for many procedures, and it's going to be an increasing focus at UCLA.""

Part of a massive, systemwide rebuilding project, the new Santa Monica campus features the UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica; a branch of Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA; the Los Angeles Orthopaedic Hospital; and the UCLA Rape Treatment Center. The new buildings, located at 16th Street and Wilshire Boulevard, will open for patient care in early 2012. ""We are proud to introduce another pillar of our world-class UCLA Health System,'' said UCLA Chancellor Gene Block. ""The Santa Monica campus provides a magnificent environment for healing, and it strengthens UCLA's capacity to offer the highest level of compassionate, state-of-the-art care to families in our local communities.'' The new campus complements the world-class services provided by the UCLA Health System's existing facilities, including the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, the Stewart and Lynda Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital at UCLA, Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA, and more than 80 primary and specialty offices throughout greater Los Angeles. Posie Carpenter, chief administrative officer of UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica, said the new campus will provide the full continuum of services, from neonatal intensive care to geriatric medicine, in a welcoming yet technologically advanced facility. Funding for the $572 million project was provided by multiple sources, including Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants, bond initiatives, and donations from individuals and corporations. A community celebration for the new campus will be held on Sunday, Sept. 18, from 1 to 4 p.m. Members of the public are invited for tours, health screenings, children's activities, musical entertainment, refreshments and giveaways.

""All through these 10 years, I accepted it, thinking it was normal,"" says the 54-year-old administrative manager. But the symptoms James was experiencing were anything but normal. Deterioration in the discs of his neck caused the bones to press against and choke his spinal cord, triggering the pain and numbness, explains Nick Shamie, M.D., an orthopaedic surgeon with the UCLA Spine Center. ""Because this had happened gradually, he had gotten used to it and he had accepted this as part of aging when, in fact, his rest of the body was not aging as rapidly as his neck was,"" Dr. Shamie says. Dr. Shamie operated to correct the condition. Through a 4-inch incision in James's neck, he removed painful bone spurs, protruding discs and deteriorating vertebrae, and replaced them with a plastic spacer and supporting plate. James returned home the day after the surgery and quickly resumed normal activities. The operation ""gave me my life back,"" he says. Since his surgery, James has been pain-free. ""I had an outcome that I didn't believe was possible,"" he says. Dr. Shamie notes that ""surgery nowadays has become incredibly safe."" It is less invasive and there are better methods for treating problems. Patients in pain ""don't need to continue living with pain,"" he says.

In early March a variant--of a sort, anyway--played out at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center when one Southern California corrections officer gave a kidney to another from a different facility. They were complete strangers to each other and only met for the first time about a week before their March 8 surgery, when both came to UCLA for their final blood cross match and clinic appointments. It all started in October, when California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) Officer Gaston Benjamin of Lancaster, Calif., who works in the Antelope Valley facility, found out that his kidneys were failing due to a genetic condition that also struck one of his sisters, putting her on dialysis. A single father of four young children, he was worried about his future...and that of his family. His diagnosis was all the more surprising in that he did not exhibit any symptoms and had learned of it only during a routine medical examination. But by chance Officer Benjamin ran into Ken Lewis, a community resource manager for the California prison system, at a local Walmart. Officer Benjamin told Lewis about his deteriorating health - the fatigue and other attendant problems associated with declining kidney function--and of his fears for the future. More than 100,000 people were on the waiting list for a kidney, he said, and the odds were not in his favor. Lewis quickly stepped into action and generated a flyer he sent out by e-mail to about 40,000 CDCR fellow employees. Nearly 20 responded that they would be willing to donate a kidney to Officer Benjamin. Two were a match and Officer Luis Hernandez, a guard at the facility in Calipatria, was the perfect match. Strangers until the call for help, Officer Hernandez and Officer Benjamin have become fast friends.

As these children grow, and the valves become dysfunctional, they require as many as five or more open-heart surgeries over the course of their lifetimes to replace poorly functioning valves. A promising new catheter-based approach to replacing these valves may help patients reduce the number of required surgeries, and minimize side effects, by moving the procedure from the operating room to the cardiac-catheterization lab. ""After the first open-heart surgery, it's daunting for our patients to think they may need four or more additional open-heart surgeries during their lives,"" explains Daniel Levi, M.D., pediatric cardiologist at Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA, who has been part of the team responsible for using the new transcatheter system to replace pulmonary heart valves in 12 pediatric and adult patients at UCLA. ""When we tell them we can replace their pulmonary valves through a small incision in the leg instead, rather than opening their chest with a large, painful incision, they are very excited."" The new procedure takes only a few hours, avoids the need for the heart-lung machine and minimizes pain and lengthy hospital stays, Dr. Levi notes. The pulmonary valve opens and closes to let blood flow from the right lower chamber of the heart (right ventricle) to the lungs and prevents blood from flowing back from the artery into the heart. These valves may not function properly in patients with congenital heart defects and need to be replaced with a conduit to prop open a section of the right ventricle and an artificial valve ‚Äî fitted inside the conduit ‚Äî to regulate the blood flow. These conduits, however, wear out over time and need to be replaced. The new procedure is the first minimally invasive alternative to open-heart surgery for pediatric and adult patients who require a replacement conduit and valve to restore pulmonary function. ""It's much less invasive,"" says UCLA adult congenital cardiologist Jamil Aboulhosn, M.D., who explains that the procedure is performed through a catheter (a thin, hollow tube) holding an artificial heart valve that is inserted into a leg or neck vein and guided to the heart. The artificial valve is attached to a wire frame that expands with the help of balloons to deliver the valve. ""Patients walk out of the hospital the next day with minimal side effects and no major scarring,"" Dr. Aboulhosn says. By comparison, patients undergoing openheart surgery to replace their pulmonary valves spend, on average, seven days in the hospital, including a few days in the Intensive Care Unit, followed by eight to 12 weeks of recovery at home. Small patients (those under 60 pounds), those with large conduits and patients with coronary arteries positioned too near the conduit are not candidates for the procedure, according to Dr. Aboulhosn.

The hospital, which has expanded from two buildings on a single city block to a campus spanning several city blocks, represents the best of an academic medical center combined with a community hospital, says the hospital's chief administrative officer, Posie Carpenter. ""We will provide all of the benefits of a worldclass academic medical center in a setting that provides the comfort and convenience of a community hospital,"" Carpenter notes. The hospital was built in phases while remaining open to the community. The Tower building, which sustained the most damage from the earthquake, was retrofitted, recommissioned and licensed by the state to operate while construction of the campus continued. ""This has been a very complex building project,"" Carpenter says. The main hospital facility includes a series of four new buildings, in addition to the existing Merle Norman Pavilion, organized in a horseshoe layout, with the main entrance on 16th Street. The number of licensed inpatient beds will be reduced from 315 to 266, but most of the beds in the new hospital will be in private rooms, which makes the available capacity similar between the old and new facilities. The extended campus will stretch from 12th Street to 18th Street on Wilshire Boulevard, then south to Arizona Avenue. According to Carpenter, expanding space and services over an extended period of time comes with challenges. ""An academic medical center takes considerably more space, and often uses different processes, than a community hospital,"" she says. When it is completed, the renovated complex will have the increased resources to provide patients with the best possible care, Carpenter concludes. What's in Store Key features of the new campus include: Orthopaedic Hospital facility on 15th Street and Wilshire Boulevard, featuring an outpatient clinic, the UCLA Department of Orthopaedics' administrative and faculty offices, other administrative offices, a library and a museum 16,000-square-foot Nethercutt Emergency Center on 15th Street (opened in 2007), with an onsite, 64-slice CT Scanner Comprehensive maternity services, including a Labor & Delivery Unit, a 16-bassinet Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and Santa Monica's only general pediatrics and Pediatric Intensive Care units A new 22-bed Critical Care Unit Integrated interventional and surgical services occupying the entire third floor of the new facility, including 16 operating rooms, additional interventional radiology and cardiac-catheterization labs, as well as a pre- and post-anesthesia care unit A three-story outpatient surgery and oncology building on 16th Street, with eight operating rooms for outpatient surgery, two radiation-oncology units for cancer treatment, laboratories and medical offices New cafeteria containing both indoor and outdoor seating areas Operations center to support UCLA Health System, located on Michigan Avenue and Cloverfield Boulevard Learn more at www.uclahealth.org/SantaMonica","Remodel,new facility,neonatal intensive care unit,dennis woo,pediatric unit,santa monica birthplace,wally ghurabi,oncology unit,Santa Monica UCLA,Posie Carpenter,Santa Monica hospital,SMUCLA",28,"Science & Technology","Health,Knowledge",PT6M3S,363,2d,sd,false,,,,,,,,15503,44,,0,4

She likes to fish with her dad, play sports at school, and, as the youngest girl in a blended family of five siblings, enjoys a close relationship with her mom. But Cheyann also endures daily nosebleeds so heavy that they drench her clothes in blood. They can last anywhere from a couple of minutes to an hour. Like her mother and older brother, she suffers from a genetic disorder called hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, or HHT. Frequently misdiagnosed, HHT affects 1 in 5,000 people, and many people unknowingly pass the gene on to their children. ""My uncle's cousin died from a brain hemorrhage. And that's how the family found out that we have HHT"" explained Stacy Cooper, Cheyann's mother. ""That's when we could finally put a name to it. I'm sure that's what my grandfather also died of. But at the time, they didn't know what it was."" Due to this faulty gene, many of Cheyann's blood vessels connect abnormally. Her arterial blood surges directly into her veins without first squeezing through tiny capillaries, which normally reduce the high pressure of arterial blood flow. In Cheyann's older relatives who also have the disorder, fragile red dots called telangiectasias form on the face and fingertips, where they can rupture and spurt fountains of blood. Her own grandfather requires regular blood transfusions and iron supplements to combat the rapid blood loss, which can result in anemia, dizziness and fainting. The real danger for Cheyann lies in her larger abnormal blood vessels, called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which may lurk silently in her brain, lungs and liver. Invisible inside the body, AVMs can burst without warning, leading to massive internal bleeding, stroke, organ failure and death. Fortunately, medicine has made great strides in treating HHT. Recently, Cheyann and her mother drove from their home in Sonora, Calif., to see Dr. Justin McWilliams, co-director of UCLA's HHT Center for Excellence, where a multidisciplinary team of specialists trained in the genetic testing, diagnosis and clinical management of the disease can help her live a normal life. Cheyann underwent an MRI scan and ultrasound exam to uncover AVMs in her brain or lungs. The screenings will enable UCLA specialists to detect and treat any AVMs they find before the lesions rupture. ""Unlike many genetic diseases, HHT's medical problems can be tested for and fixed,"" explained Dr. McWilliams. ""Early screening and genetic testing are critical, because they can save lives and prevent serious complications before they arise."" With help from the center's genetic counselor, Cheyann's mother will be able to identify other family members at risk and trace HHT through past generations. Interestingly, Cheyann's twin brother did not inherit the disease. ""Many health providers are unfamiliar with HHT and often dismiss repeated nosebleeds as nothing to worry about,"" said genetic counselor Michelle Fox. ""After one family member is diagnosed with HHT, a simple blood test enables us to identify the gene mutation and monitor other affected relatives without expensive imaging studies."" Unfortunately, said Stacy Cooper, the frequent nosebleeds will continue for her daughter. ""It's kind of embarrassing,"" Cheyann said, especially when they happen in school ""because I get teased. They're always asking me,'Why do you always get bloody noses?' I can't really tell them"" But knowing about the AVMs and whether or not they need to be treated makes a huge difference, said her mother. ""We just want to make sure that wherever they are, we get treated. ""It's nice to be able to say,'HHT' and have a doctor know what it is and understand what we're going through ‚Äî and care,"" she said.

Some 40,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer are diagnosed each year, and by the time diagnosis is made, up to 80 percent of patients are no longer candidates for treatment. ""I had no symptoms,"" Rae says. ""I had absolutely no symptoms. None whatsoever."" But Rae was, in a way, lucky. Because she had a family history of the disease - her mother, uncle and older sister all died from the disease - she underwent early screening, which detected the cancer at an early stage. ""We're working hard to develop tests for earlier diagnosis,"" says Howard Reber, M.D., director of the UCLA Pancreatic Cancer Program. The goal is to create something similar to the PSA test now done to detect prostate cancer in its early stages, before it has had a chance to spread. ""In patients where we know that there's an increased likelihood of the development of the disease, we can screen them, we can get CT scans, we can get endoscopic ultrasounds,"" Dr. Reber says. In Rae's case, the cancer was detected and found to be contained, but it was growing fast. Surgery was performed to remove the cancer, and now, following surgery and chemotherapy, Rae is cancer free.

The heart transplantation team at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical is currently leading a national, multicenter phase 2 clinical study of an experimental organ-preservation system that allows donor hearts to continue functioning in a near-physiologic state outside the body during transport. The Organ Care System (OCS), developed by medical device company TransMedics, works this way: After a heart is removed from a donor's body, it is placed in a high-tech OCS box and is immediately revived to a beating state, perfused with oxygen and nutrient-rich blood, and maintained at an appropriate temperature. The device also features monitors that display how the heart is functioning during transport. The current standard of transporting donor hearts in iceboxes in a non-functioning state, which has been used for decades, requires the restarting of the heart once it has been placed inside the recipient. ""The concept of transplanting a donor heart in a beating state is revolutionary,"" said Dr. Abbas Ardehali (http://uclahealth.org/AbbasArdehali), surgical director of the heart and lung transplantation program at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and principal investigator of the OCS trial. ""This promising technology may improve the function of the donor heart, because it remains in a near-physiologic state. It can also help us better assess the suitability of a potential donor, since we can test the heart in the device."" Ardehali said the technology could also lead to better tissue matching between donor hearts and recipients because the box would grant the transplant team more time to test the heart for potential rejection factors.

But in 2001 he had to retire from racing when he noticed that his car would not respond the way he thought his hands and feet were telling it to while driving. He was diagnosed with Huntington's disease, a progressive neurological disorder. ""It was starting to invade my racing,"" John Paul recalls. ""I was having to actually talk my way around the track. I was having to tell myself to turn, accelerate, brake, instead of it just flowing."" Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder that causes degeneration of cells in certain areas of the brain, leading to uncontrolled movements, loss of intellectual faculties and emotional disturbance. John Paul's grandmother and mother also had the disease. But the recent discovery of the Huntington gene -- a mutation of one gene that sets in motion an attack deep within the area of the brain called the basal ganglia -- offers hope for those with Huntington's disease as well as patient's with other neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. ""As we develop better understanding for what's causing Huntington's, then targeted approaches can be made to stop the problems from happening with the ultimate goal of trying to delay the onset of the disease or slow down the progression of the disease, to stop the damage from happening,"" says UCLA neurologist Yvette Bordelon, M.D., Ph.D., a member of the UCLA Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Studies. ""A few years after the gene had been found, there were maybe three human clinical trials that had been done or were being conducted in Huntington's disease. Now there are 21."" John Paul's hope is that new discoveries will come in time to help his own children, who, like him, may have inherited the defective gene from their parent. That, says his half-sister, AJ Paul, ""would be his ultimate winning race.""","John Paul Jr,huntington's disease,huntington gene,Dr. Susan Perlman,Dr. Yvette Bordelon,UCLA Neurology",28,"Science & Technology","Health,Knowledge",PT4M25S,265,2d,sd,false,,,,,,,,74441,335,,0,98

Faced with the need to see a myriad of specialized physicians, they sometimes struggle to find answers to the questions that inevitably arise between appointments ‚Äî and often end up relying on the emergency room, the nation's most expensive form of care. In an effort to better coordinate the care of these patients ‚Äî including children with cancer, heart disease, spina bifida and other musculoskeletal abnormalities, craniofacial abnormalities and severe gastrointestinal disorders ‚Äî Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA established the Pediatric Medical Home Program at UCLA. The program is the first of its kind and has demonstrated impressive results that have placed it at the forefront of a national effort to transform primary care for children. In the first study to look at the benefits of the medical-home concept in a specialized children's hospital, UCLA researchers have found that participation in the program reduced emergency room visits by 55 percent, as well as improved patient satisfaction levels. ""The medical-home model stresses the importance of continuous, accessible outpatient care,"" says pediatric cardiologist Thomas Klitzner, M.D., executive director of the Pediatric Medical Home Program at UCLA, which conducted the study. ""Parents told us that when they had a concern that they might have previously thought would require an emergency room visit, they now had someone to call. They felt empowered to use scheduled outpatient primary care and specialty visits rather than using the emergency department to get care."" The medical-home concept does not refer to a physical location; it is an approach to medical care that is accessible, compassionate, continuous, comprehensive, coordinated, culturally effective and family centered. The child's pediatrician and parents act as partners in identifying and accessing necessary medical and nonmedical services. The UCLA program, based on guidelines established by the American Academy of Pediatrics, includes four basic components: a formal 60-minute intake appointment, follow-up appointments of 40 minutes (twice the length of standard appointments), access to a bilingual family liaison to help families navigate the medical system, and a family binder that keeps all of a child's medical information in one place. Dr. Klitzner decided to launch the program after concluding it could not only improve the quality of care but could reduce costs by eliminating unnecessary services. The findings of his pilot study have drawn considerable interest. Kellie Ernzen Kruger, M.D., an internist and pediatrician at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center and Orthopaedic Hospital, says she has noticed significant improvement in the quality of care complex patients are provided through the medical-home concept. ""When you are a primary care provider trying to coordinate care for patients with complicated medical issues, it's very helpful to have access to all of the information from the specialists and to be able to communicate easily and effectively with them,"" Dr. Kruger explains. ""The medical home helps to foster that kind of communication, which translates to better care and greater satisfaction among patients and their families.""

At the same time, we are constantly engaged in an inner dialogue, ruminating about the past, musing about the future. Somehow the brain filters all this input instantly, selecting some things for long- or short-term storage, discarding others and focusing in on what's most important at any given instant. How this competition is resolved across multiple sensory and cognitive regions in the brain is not known; nor is it clear how internal thoughts and attention decide what wins in this continual contest of stimulation. Now a collaboration between UCLA scientists and colleagues from the California Institute of Technology has shown that humans can actually regulate the activity of specific neurons in the brain, increasing the firing rate of some while decreasing the rate of others. And study subjects were able to do so by manipulating an image on a computer screen using only their thoughts. Reporting in the Oct. 28 issue of the journal Nature, UCLA professor of neurosurgery Itzhak Fried and Caltech neuroscientist Christof Koch, along with colleagues, recorded the activity of single neurons in patients implanted with intracranial electrodes (for clinical reasons) and demonstrated that humans regulate the activity of their neurons to intentionally alter the outcome of all this stimulation.

The Hoop-A-Thon is a one-of-a-kind speed free-throw shooting contest. All proceeds from this event go to the UCLA Center of Excellence for patient care and services as well as research for a cure of Huntington's Disease (HD). UCLA Head Men's Basketball Coach Ben Howland and his wife, Kim, were honorary co-chairs of the HDSA LA Hoop-A-Thon. The event took place in legendary Pauley Pavilion on Friday, Aug. 28, 2009 from 6-10 p.m. HD directly affects Howland's family as his father-in-law, Arlo Zahnow, had Huntington's Disease. HD also affected John Paul Jr., one of the nation's top professional race car drivers. HD is a devastating genetic disorder that causes uncontrollable body movements and deprives people of their abilities to walk, talk, eat and think rationally. This disease is currently incurable and it is fatal. The gene that causes HD is a mutant of a normal gene. The defective gene causes chemical changes in nerve cells that damages brain structures leading to symptoms. The process that causes nerve cells to die in HD may have similarities to other, more common, disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Insights into HD may prove useful to understanding these other disorders. Huntington's Disease is rare but that doesn't make it any less devastating. HD is a tragic reality affecting 30,000 families in America. The facts are grim for HD: There is no cure, it's fatal and because it's rare, funding for research is sparse. But there is hope. Since HD is caused by a type of genetic mutation that is shared by a host of other disorders, solving HD can lead the way to treatments, and ultimately cures for all of them. We are closer than ever to finding a cure! We can help raise the much needed funds for research and do our part to inspire hope in those families affected by this fatal brain disorder.

He wasn't a candidate for further radiation or surgery to remove the prostate so his options were limited. Dwight chose a new non-invasive treatment currently only being offered through clinical trials at academic sites in the United States - UCLA is the only site on the West Coast. Called HIFU (High Intensity Focused Ultrasound), the technique delivers sound waves aimed at the prostate tissue, which rapidly increases tissue temperature, destroying the cancerous lesions. Three months after Dwight had the HIFU outpatient procedure at UCLA his PSA levels were undetectable. His UCLA urologists, Dr. Leonard Marks and Dr. Allan Pantuck, are pleased with these early results. Although his doctors note that Dwight's experience may not be typical and side effects may vary amongst patients. To qualify for the clinical trial, participants must have recurrent prostate cancer after treatment with external beam radiation therapy. Initial screening visits will involve physical exams, blood tests and an ultrasound of the prostate. Qualifying participants will receive the outpatient HIFU procedure under anesthesia and follow-up for a year after treatment. All study-related costs, including the HIFU treatment, will be covered by the research study. The study is sponsored by Focus Surgery, Inc., manufacturer of the The Sonablate¬Æ 500 system, which is the HIFU technology used in the study. Several thousand HIFU procedures have been performed in other countries, but the treatment is currently considered investigational in the United States. The UCLA study is part of an FDA-approved clinical trial. For more information about the study, please call Malu Macairan, research coordinator, at 310-794-3566.

For many patients with severe depression ‚Äî characterized by an all-encompassing low mood and loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities ‚Äî who have tried without success to relieve their symptoms with at least one round of medication, there now is a therapy that stimulates the brain, but does so without general anesthesia or lingering aftereffects. Called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), the procedure uses magnetic fields to change the activity in a specific area of the brain thought to influence mood and emotion to improve the symptoms of severe depression, explains Ian Cook, M.D., director of the UCLA Depression Research and Clinic Program. The procedure is conducted in an office setting; a patient undergoing TMS sits in a chair resembling a recliner, while a large electromagnet is precisely positioned over his or her head to emit targeted electromagnetic pulses. While the patient's head is gently secured in place, he or she is fully awake during the 45-minute sessions and is able to read, converse, watch videos or listen to music. The therapy is conducted five days a week over four to six weeks. ""Some people like to take a nap. Others like to meditate. All they really experience is the sensation of a tapping on the scalp from the magnetic field, even though nothing is mechanically tapping there,"" Dr. Cook says. Patients wishing to undergo TMS at UCLA are reviewed by a committee, which discusses each case to ensure that the patient is an appropriate candidate. Results from clinical trials have been promising, Dr. Cook points out. After six weeks, about 54 percent of patients reported improvement in their mood, and 33 percent were in remission from their depression.

The approach, pioneered for the last several years by Joseph Demer, M.D., Ph.D., ophthalmologist at UCLA's Jules Stein Eye Institute, has significantly expanded the number of people with strabismus who can benefit from surgery, not only by offering a procedure without the risks of general anesthesia, but also by facilitating surgical treatment for patients with smaller angles of strabismus than in the past. Strabismus, in which the eyes fail to line up in the same direction when focusing, is the major cause of double vision in older adults. Until now, patients with strabismus at a large enough angle have been treated with surgery under general anesthesia to manipulate the eye muscles in an effort to correct the problem. Since the result couldn't be determined until the patient was awake, a second procedure was often required in an effort to achieve the desired outcome. Patients with small-angle strabismus, or whose general health makes them poor candidates for major surgery, have used thick and cumbersome prismatic glasses to manage their symptoms. ""These glasses are sometimes effective, and sometimes not,"" Dr. Demer notes. ""But even when they do help, the ability to free patients from being dependent on prisms ‚Äî especially since many have had cataract and laser surgery so that they don't need spectacles other than for their double vision ‚Äî is a major benefit."" The traditional surgical methods tended to ""overshoot"" the correction for patients with small angles of displacement, essentially giving them double vision in the other direction, Dr. Demer explains. With the minimally invasive procedure, instead of detaching the eye muscle completely, the surgeon can partially trim the tendons of the muscle, allowing the remaining tendons to stretch so that smaller angles of misalignment can be treated more reliably. All of this is done in 15-20 minutes, without the grogginess and bandages that come with general anesthesia. ""It's like getting a filling at the dentist ‚Äî you can go right back to your normal activities later that day."" ""Many adult patients with double vision have been told that surgery is not an option,"" Dr. Demer adds, ""but with this minimally invasive approach they are now candidates.""

Penelope Gordon was among those youngsters facing an uncertain future when she was airlifted to Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA after becoming desperately ill following a visit to her great-grandparent's house. At UCLA, doctors diagnosed the 1-year-old with dilated cardiomyopathy - her heart was twice its normal size with only 5 percent of function. Dilated cardiomyopathy is life-threatening, and the child's case was urgent. Her physicians tried medications; still, Penelope's heart continued to fail. She was placed on a pediatric heart-lung machine, but that could sustain her for only two-to-three weeks before grave complications set in. What she needed to survive was a transplant. Because donor hearts are in short supply - particularly for infants and children - Penelope needed a bridge, a child-size device that could take over the pumping function of her damaged heart and keep her alive until a suitable organ became available. That bridge was the Berlin Heart, a revolutionary new ventricular assist device designed specifically for children, from infants to teenagers. As one of the country's foremost heart-transplant programs, as well as a leading research and teaching institution, UCLA is among a limited number of U.S. medical centers that are implanting the Berlin Heart under terms of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational device exemption study. Because the Berlin Heart is relatively compact and mobile, Penelope was not tethered to her hospital bed. And she remained awake and alert. Her parents were able to put her in a wagon and take her out of her room for trips down the halls and outside. That mobility enables ""the children to essentially lead a somewhat normal existence and allows all their organs to improve, such as their kidneys and their lung function, before the transplant,"" says Brian Reemtsen, M.D., chief of pediatric congenital heart surgery at UCLA. Eight months after receiving the Berlin Heart, Penelope, now 2 years old, got her new heart. Two weeks later, she was out of the hospital. ""Penny's doing fantastic,"" says Juan Alejos, M.D., medical director of the Pediatric Heart Transplant Program. ""Granted this is going to mean medications and doctors' visits, but I think that the Berlin Heart basically saved her life."" For her parents, Stephen and Jina Gordon, Penelope's survival is nothing short of a miracle. Her father says: ""That was so good, having our daughter back, oh so good.""

For an entire year afterward, the man who once routinely hiked 6-7 miles a day in the hills above his Southern California home could not walk a step. ""It scared the heck out of me,"" he recalled. ""I couldn't get up out of bed. I gained 25 pounds, which I still need to lose. I was very depressed. I couldn't work at my job as a machinist at Lockheed Martin or do anything."" His primary care physician fi rst thought Mark was suffering from peripheral arterial damage caused by his diabetes. But an MRI detected that Mark's inability to walk due to severe pain from his buttocks all the way to his feet was caused by lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) in his L3 and L4 vertebrae. What is Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (LSS)? LSS is a narrowing of the spinal canal that impinges on the nerves in the spinal canal or on the nerves exiting to the legs. This can lead to persistent pain in the buttocks, limping, lack of feeling in lower extremities and decreased physical activity. LSS is the largest indication for back surgery in people over 50, who make up the fastest growing demographic population in the world. It is estimated that 1.2 million people in the United States alone suffer from LSS, with over 200,000 diagnosed patients admitted to U.S. hospitals annually. Patients who are diagnosed with LSS initially receive conservative treatment such as bed rest, support devices, physical therapy and pain medications before moving on to surgical remedies. Initially, conservative treatment allowed Mark to walk short distances and return to work. Discovering an Option to Major Surgery After three years of conservative treatment, Mark was fed up with his inability to walk more than six minutes without feeling severe pain. He was in constant pain at his job, where he stood most of the time. Mark refused to consider major back surgery such as a laminectomy because he feared at his age he would never heal completely from the procedure where bone is removed. He was losing hope that anything could be done for his pain. Then his general practitioner suggested that he talk to surgeons at the University of California, Los Angeles. There he met orthopaedic surgeon Dr. Arya Nick Shamie and learned of a new, minimally invasive surgical procedure with Kyphon's X-STOP¬Æ Interspinous Process Decompression System. ""Mark was the perfect candidate for this surgery since his pain went away when he sat down or fl exed forward and came back when he stood up or started walking,"" said Dr. Shamie. ""The X-STOP spacer puts the patient's spine in a seated position even when standing up."" Mark was impressed with Dr. Shamie's knowledge of the procedure and felt confi dent knowing that he was renowned for his expertise with the X-STOP spacer. Since being trained on the procedure in 2005, Dr. Shamie has performed approximately 80 surgeries. On November 19, 2007, Mark was implanted with an X-STOP spacer, which increased the area of the spinal canal and relieved the pain caused by his LSS. He was under local anesthesia and the entire procedure took about an hour. ""Dr. Shamie told me that I would probably need to stay in the hospital for one day, but 30 minutes after the surgery I was up and walking with no pain, so I went home that day,"" Mark said. ""My symptoms were reduced instantly. Even now, I have no pain in my lower legs or buttocks. It is perfect. I would have done this sooner if I had known about it."" Looking Forward to Pain Free Life Mark is looking forward now to retiring next year and working part-time as an aircraft mechanic. This retirement dream, he said, is something he couldn't have realized without the X-STOP procedure. He is getting back in shape by walking every day with his dog in the hills above his Southern California home. ""My dog really missed that. Before my surgery, I hadn't walked with her in 2¬Ω years,"" Mark said.

Her enlarged tonsils blocked her airway, causing her to snore and making it difficult to breathe. Her doctor recommended a tonsillectomy to remove the enlarged tonsils. However, instead of undergoing the traditional procedure, Isabel had her tonsils removed with a newer technique called Coblation tonsillectomy, offered at UCLA's Mattel Children's Hospital. Derived from the words ""controlled ablation,"" Coblation uses radio frequency energy to remove tissue through a significantly cooler process than traditional electrosurgery or lasers. ""The Coblation tonsillectomy is a gentle alternative that eliminates most of the pain and recovery time associated with tonsillectomies of the past,"" said Dr. Nina Shapiro, assistant professor of pediatric otolaryngology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. ""This technique gently breaks down tissue surrounding the tonsil instead of burning or cutting it out, which means less damage to the surrounding tissue and virtually no bleeding."" Using the Coblation wand device, the surgeon places the tip against the base of the tonsil to remove precisely the tissue attaching the tonsil to the throat. The surgeon then uses a foot pedal to control and activate the low-temperature, radio-frequency energy and saline conductive solution from the wand tip to the area around the tonsil. This action creates a plasma field that gently breaks down the targeted tissue. The wand also contains a coagulation feature that allows the surgeon to stop any bleeding quickly. The Coblation tonsillectomy takes less than 15 minutes and is performed on an outpatient basis in an operating room under general anesthesia. ""With the traditional tonsillectomy, patients suffered sore throats, needed more pain medication and took a week or two to recuperate,"" Shapiro said. ""Now, I'm finding that with this technique, patients can drink and eat a few hours after surgery, require less pain medication, and return to normal activity within a few days."" Tonsils are oval-shaped masses of lymphatic tissue located at the back of the throat that aid the body in fighting infections. Approximately 500,000 tonsillectomies are performed on children each year, making it the second-most common childhood surgery performed in the United States. Although tonsils may need to be removed because of repeated infections, they are more likely to be taken out because they've grown too large for the child's airway. ""When children sleep, the muscles of the throat relax, and if the tonsils are enlarged they can press against the throat. This obstruction causes snoring, breathing difficulties and even sleep apnea,"" Shapiro said. ""Ultimately, sleeping problems lead to either daytime fatigue or hyperactivity, as well as other behavioral problems, because the child is sleep-deprived."" The Federal Drug Administration approved Coblation for use in tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy procedures in July 2001. Since the first Coblation tonsillectomy was performed in January 2000, physicians have performed more than 50,000 procedures worldwide. Isabel was home eating ice cream less than a few hours after her procedure and her parents said they were very pleased with the results. ""Isabel's healing process went so smoothly. She had very little pain and was back to her normal self very quickly,"" reported her mother, Raquel Sandford. ""And, the original symptoms are gone ‚Äî no more runny nose or snoring ‚Äî she's quiet as a mouse when she sleeps!""

The RP-6 robot, made by InTouch Health Inc. in Santa Barbara, Calif., allows doctors to ""virtually"" consult with patients, family members and health care staff at a moment's notice, even if miles away from the hospital. Intensivists ‚Äî the physicians who specialize in the care of critically ill patients ‚Äî in the neurosurgery department at UCLA are using RP-6 to provide additional monitoring from their homes and offices of ICU patients in response to studies showing that intensivist presence in the ICU can decrease morbidity, mortality, length of stay and cost of care. The project, to be funded through an assistance agreement with the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center, located at Ft. Detrick, Md., will be led by professor and Chief of Neurosurgery Dr. Neil Martin, associate professor Dr. Paul Vespa and associate professor Valeriy Nenov, all of the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. There is a nationwide shortage of intensivists. There are fewer than 6,000 practicing intensivists in the United States today and more than 5 million patients admitted to ICUs annually. Therefore, only about 37 percent of ICU patients receive intensivist care, yet having trained intensivists in the ICU results in better outcomes and decreased length of stay in the ICU and hospital. These specialists are familiar with complications that may occur and are therefore better able to minimize errors. UCLA will test the RP-6 robot as a way to extend the reach of the intensivist. The patient sees, hears and interacts with the doctor through the nearly 5-foot-6-inch tall robot, which displays a live video image of the physician's face on its monitor/head. The physician, seated at a computer console called a ControlStation, also sees and hears the patient through a live video image projected on a monitor. The ControlStation comes equipped with a joystick, which allows the physician to drive the robot to the patient's bedside, control movements of the robot's head and even zoom in to take a closer look at the patient or bedside monitors. ""The RP-6 robot will increase doctor access for patients, their families and hospital staff, and UCLA is excited to test the newest addition to our intensive care team"" Martin said. ""We recognize that leveraging the health care expert's time offers the possibility of improved patient care, reduced length of stay and cost savings. UCLA has combined our in-house electronic medical information system, GCQ, with the RP-6 remote presence system, and we are able to monitor and access our patients anytime from our homes and offices in a way not previously possible.""

""Lockheed Martin is proud to partner with UCLA on the important work Operation Mend is doing to provide life-changing surgeries to military members who have been severely injured while serving our country,"" said Robert J. Stevens, Lockheed Martin chairman of the board and CEO. ""We recognize that the sacrifices of our servicemen and women sometimes result in debilitating personal injury, and we are honored to help make a difference in those lives."" The gift will be equally divided between two areas of need. First, to help enhance patient experience during multiple surgeries and to accommodate patients' family members, the funding will support the renovation of the surgical waiting room and the pre- and post-operative recovery areas at UCLA, as part of the broader Ambulatory Surgical Center Enhancement Project, which includes adding four new high-tech surgical suites and a telemedicine video conference center. Currently, the ambulatory surgery patient-recovery area is restricted, because it is an open unit. In the interest of protecting patient privacy and confidentiality, and for health reasons, extended visitation is not allowed. In a new patient recovery suite, family members and loved ones will able to visit. Following surgery, Operation Mend patients will be transported to one of the four new private recovery suites, where the post-operative team will monitor blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, respiratory rate and pain. When the effects of anesthesia have diminished, visits will be permitted. The project will also add a private consultation room and create a more accommodating ambience for patients' family members. Second, the funding will help support the care of more patients in the coming years. On average, each patient requires a minimum of 10 to 20 surgeries, in addition to post-operative coordination with the referring centers, including Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, or Veterans Affairs hospitals. The combined health care and care-facilitation costs can average $500,000 per patient. ""On behalf of the wounded warriors we serve, we are so grateful for this significant gift from our lead corporate sponsor,"" said Dr. David T. Feinberg, CEO and associate vice chancellor of the UCLA Hospital System. ""Lockheed Martin's commitment to UCLA's Operation Mend program will greatly enhance the physical surroundings of where the patients are cared for, as well as ensure our ability to provide critical treatment for future wounded military personnel in the coming years."" Established in 2007, Operation Mend is a unique partnership between the UCLA Health System and the Brooke Army Medical Center. To date, 34 men and women from all branches of the military have participated in the program. All of the Operation Mend patients have suffered severely deforming burns and wounds on their face, usually as the result of explosions from improvised explosive devices. After initial surgeries and rehabilitation at military hospitals, including the renowned Brooke Army Medical Center, the wounded soldiers have the opportunity to continue their recovery at UCLA and undergo specialized reconstructive surgical techniques with Operation Mend's plastic and reconstructive surgery team. While the program started with facial reconstructive surgery, it is now beginning to expand its services to offer treatment for post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injuries and continues to receive consultation and support from the following clinical services: radiation oncology, dermatology, neurology, anesthesia/pain management, ophthalmology, orthopedics, maxillofacial/dentistry, medical tattooing, urology, lower limb transplantation, and psychiatric and social services Operation Mend prides itself on the warmth and care shown to each wounded warrior. Patients always travel to UCLA with family or a friend. They are personally escorted to and from the airport, stay at UCLA's Tiverton House hotel on campus, are escorted to all medical appointments, and have a nurse coordinator manage their case. There is no cost to the patient. In addition, each patient is paired with a volunteer ""buddy family"" that provides a social outlet during their stay in Los Angeles by having the patient over for family meals and coordinating fun activities.

Marathon cardiac arrest victim","Jay Yim, 21, had worked on improving his fitness since age 15. In preparation for this year's Los Angeles Marathon on March 21, the University of Southern California pre-med student had been training with a marathon club and regularly did 10-mile runs on his own. The day before the race, he had a carbo-loading dinner with his club members. According to his brother Roy, who spoke with him that night, Jay sounded fine and ready to go. On race day, Roy watched his brother's progress on the marathon website. ""They had a feature that allowed you to monitor a runner as he passed each milepost,"" Roy said. ""The computer estimate said, based on his progress, he'd finish in 3:15."" But as Jay reached mile 18, something went terribly wrong. He grabbed his chest and collapsed onto the road. He'd suffered a cardiac arrest. In the first in a string of amazing events that would ultimately save his life, Jay happened to fall about 70 yards from Josh Sewell, a motorcycle officer with the Los Angeles Police Department. Sewell immediately moved Jay off the course and began CPR. ""His eyes were rolling back in his head, he had no pulse and was not breathing,"" Sewell recalled. ""He was in full cardiac arrest."" Another amazing event occurred when, somehow, out of the crowd emerged off-duty physician Dr. Charles Chandler, a clinical professor of surgery at UCLA. He and Sewell continued CPR and called for an ambulance. ""After about four to five minutes, we had return of a strong pulse, but he was not spontaneously breathing,"" Chandler said. ""The paramedics arrived, took over CPR, prepared him for transport and I called our ER to give them what information we had. We got Jay loaded onto the ambulance and taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center."" At the hospital's emergency department, a team of UCLA emergency physicians and staff quickly went to work to stabilize Jay and begin the investigation into what would cause a 21-year old to experience cardiac arrest. Heading Jay's care was Dr. Paul Vespa, a professor of neurology and neurosurgery and director of UCLA's Neurointensive Care Unit. ""When he arrived at the medical center, Jay was in a coma and on a ventilator, in very critical condition,"" Vespa said. ""His brain was certainly at risk for permanent injury due to his heart attack, and we had little time to reverse this effect or even assure that he would live."" Vespa decided to use a state-of-the-art procedure known as therapeutic hypothermia on Jay to maximize his chances for recovery. ""This procedure can be lifesaving in cases like Jay's, where the brain and other organs have been deprived of oxygen for a significant amount of time and the patient is at risk of permanent organ damage or death,"" Vespa said. ""It is not widely used because it requires specialized equipment and trained staff, but it is fully approved."" Vespa and his team inserted a catheter into a large vein and began feeding cooling fluid into Jay's body. ""The process works much like a radiator cools an engine,"" Vespa said. ""The machine runs 24/7 and lowers the body temperature to 89.6 degrees. The cooling protects the body's organs until the brain has time to reboot. We kept Jay chilled for approximately 72 hours, at which time he awoke from his coma. Follow-up tests showed he has no permanent damage to his brain or other organs. He should have a perfect recovery."" Jay was moved out of intensive care on March 30 and is expected to be released from the hospital in the next few days to begin rehabilitation, hospital officials said. Doctors are still unsure of what caused his cardiac arrest. Jay's family has remained with him since his accident, and he has had another frequent visitor. ""I've spent a lot of time in Jay's room, encouraging his family and watching for signs of his recovery,"" said Sewell, the first person to come to Jay's aid. The LAPD motorcycle officer spent much of the week following the marathon in Jay's hospital room and spoke with him for more than an hour after he regained consciousness. ""We've bonded, that's for sure,"" Sewell said. ""He's a great guy. I'm just glad I was in the right place at the right time and was able to be a part of this amazing story."" ""If there is a lesson here,"" Vespa said, ""it is that more hospitals need to consider implementing therapeutic hypothermia at their institutions. It can save lives.""

Baby Paul Lucas was born in Oct. 2009. During pregnancy, his parents had no idea that he would be born with Pierre Robin Sequence resulting in a small jaw, cleft palate and big tongue. The critical problem was that when he was laid on his back, his tongue blocked his airway, causing him to turn blue and go into respiratory distress. Traditionally, a tracheostomy placed in the throat would be required; however, the child would need the tracheostomy for years until about age 7 to 11 years of age. During that time period the child may often have complications like pneumonia or more rarely children have even died. When children have trachs, they cannot eat or speak normally. They may be developmentally delayed and need a feeding tube. However, Dr. James Bradley, a UCLA pediatric plastic and reconstructive surgeon, is one of just a few surgeons nationwide that offers an alternative to trach‚Äîand it can actually fix the problem in a relatively short amount of time. As these children grow older, its practically impossible to know that they ever had a birth deformity. During surgery, the bone of the jaw is separated and distractors are put in place on both sides. Then, the baby returns to the neonatal intensive care unit for two weeks and the distraction devices are turned twice a day which helps lengthen the jaw. Ideally, the jaw will grow 3 cm by the end of the 2 week period providing enough space for the tongue to lie properly and allow normal airway breathing. The baby goes home with the distractors in place ( but hidden under the cheek) while the bone continues to grow, although no additional turning is required. The baby has outpatient surgery about 3 months later to remove the device. For parents who had no idea from prenatal scans or tests that their baby would be born with this deformity, most people are not aware of this surgery which can fix the problem and alleviate the need for a trach. For parents this process can be stressful. When they see their child change from a scary situation of not being able to breathe or feed, to a normal situation of feeding and breathing in a few weeks, they are elated.

But for the estimated 1-2 percent of children with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), these thoughts and behaviors become so intense they can be both greatly distressing and disruptive of the childs ability to function. UCLAs Semel Institute and the Stewart and Lynda Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital at UCLA have opened one of the nations few hospital-based intensive outpatient treatment programs for these children. The UCLA Pediatric OCD Intensive Outpatient Program provides three hours of daily individual and group treatment for children ages 8-17, along with family therapy, parent education and support, and medication management. The program is offered four days a week for a minimum of two weeks, depending on the severity of the childs disorder. The severity and types of symptoms exhibited by children with OCD vary greatly, says R. Lindsey Bergman, Ph.D., the programs director. Though OCD is often portrayed as a fear of contamination or the need for things to be orderly, there is a wide range of symptoms. Dr. Bergman explains that most people with OCD have both obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are anxiety-producing, difficult-to-control intrusive thoughts and fears, while compulsions are behaviors or rituals typically developed in an attempt to reduce the anxiety associated with the obsessive thoughts. A compulsion can also appear unrelated to an intrusive thought. For example, sometimes a behavior such as counting or touching is done repetitively until it feels right rather than because an intrusive thought triggered the behavior. In other cases, the ritual or behavior can be directly related or in response to the obsessive thought. For instance, fear of contamination can lead the child to want to avoid physical contact or public spaces. A childs concern about having the numbers and letters on schoolwork look just right can lead to constant erasing until there are holes in the paper and the work is never completed. Religious or moral obsessions, termed obsessive scrupulosity, may result in compulsive confessions or praying for forgiveness, even over the smallest incident or behavior that others would not judge as objectionable. Research has provided evidence for two effective OCD treatments, Dr. Bergman says. One is medication, most commonly in the form of prescribed selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors. The other ‚Äî often used in combination with the medication ‚Äî is a particular form of cognitive behavioral therapy called exposure and response prevention. The child is exposed to the feared thought while resisting engaging in the compulsive behavior, in a graduated fashion ‚Äî practicing at first with something thats just a little bit scary, Dr. Bergman explains. A reward system is used to reinforce the childs attempts at engaging in exposure activities regardless of their success in resisting compulsions. Over time, and with follow-up at home, compulsive behaviors are extinguished as the exposures demonstrate that negative consequences do not result when the compulsive behavior or ritual is resisted. www.uclahealth.org","juvenile OCD,obsessive-compulsive disorder,OCD treatment,Semel Institute,Dr. R.

Corneal transplantation, which replaces a patients damaged cornea with donor corneal tissue, is the most common and most successful type of human transplant surgery; approximately 40,000 procedures are performed in the United States each year. The cornea ‚Äî the clear tissue that forms the front of the eye ‚Äî can become diseased, affecting vision and requiring transplantation as a result of a variety of conditions, including progressive distortion in the shape of the cornea (keratoconus), scarring secondary to infection or injury, and inherited dysfunction of the corneas inner layer, leading to corneal swelling (Fuchs dystrophy). Until recently, the procedure of choice for most of these patients was what is called a full-thickness corneal transplant, also known as a penetrating keratoplasty, in which the full thickness of the cornea is replaced, even if only a portion of the cornea is diseased. But several new procedures have emerged that are designed to remove and replace only the affected layer of the cornea. For patients whose vision is affected by swelling in the corneas inner-most layer, the Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK) ‚Äî which involves peeling off the diseased inner layer and replacing it with the inner-most layer from a donor cornea ‚Äî avoids the astigmatism (irregular shape of the cornea, resulting in blurred vision) commonly associated with full-thickness corneal transplantation. Visual recovery is also more rapid than with a full-thickness transplant, Dr. Aldave says. By contrast, the deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) involves replacing everything but the corneas inner layer. The primary advantage of this procedure, for patients with corneal scarring or keratoconus but with a healthy endothelium (inner layer), is that it eliminates the risk of rejection and failure of the endothelial cells that are critical to keeping the cornea clear. As the patient retains his or her own corneal endothelium, the donor tissue does not need to have a healthy endothelium, and thus the requirements for the donor cornea are less stringent. The newest approach to corneal transplantation uses a femtosecond laser ‚Äî the same technology employed for making flaps in LASIK surgery ‚Äî to produce incisions in the cornea that enable the surgeon to exercise far more precision in what is removed, so that the transplanted tissue fits into the cornea like interlocking pieces of a puzzle. As with the DSEK, this gives us the potential to dramatically decrease postoperative astigmatism because of the precision of the laser, and it strengthens the wound site so that it is more resistant to traumatic opening in the event of eye injury following surgery, Dr. Aldave says. The news is also good for patients with diseased corneas who are not candidates for transplantation using donor tissue. Instead, some of these patients may be candidates for an artificial-cornea transplant. These are patients who had previously been told there was nothing that could be done for them, Dr. Aldave notes. With the new approaches, Dr. Aldave concludes, We can now customize corneal transplant surgery for the individual patient, resulting in better outcomes. www.jsei.org","corneal transplantation",28,"Science & Technology","Health,Knowledge",PT3M12S,192,2d,sd,false,,,,,,,,40234,171,,0,90

It took a liver transplant to save her. When Leiauna's pregnancy ended tragically with the in utero death of her baby, doctors discovered that her liver had been badly damaged by gestational hypertension. She was transferred to UCLA and placed on the list for an emergency transplant. Three days later, the surgical team, headed by Dr. Ronald Busuttil, replaced Leiauna's liver with a healthy organ from a 19-year-old woman who had died in an accident. Although she was told she could no longer bear children, Leiauna and her husband now have a son, conceived in vitro and carried by a sister-in-law. Today, she counts herself fortunate to be alive. ""An organ truly is the gift of life,"" she says. ""Because of the gift of a donated organ, I was able to live, and so was our son, Rex."" Besides motherhood, Leiauna makes time to be an ambassador for organ donation, educating others about the importance of donating organs. ""There are over 100,000 people waiting for organs--that's more people than can fit into the Rose Bowl! Everyday people are added, and everyday people die who are waiting for organs,"" she said. Leiauna's liver transplant is among the nearly 5,000 that have been performed at UCLA since the Liver Transplant Program was started here 25 years ago.

And when it came time for Loutensock to make a choice to help his old friend - Landros needed a life-saving transplant after polycystic kidney disease had nearly destroyed his organs - he didn't hesitate to donate one of his own kidneys. ""We get one chance to live our lives and do good things,"" says Loutensock. ""It will literally be a chance to give Alan his life back, and that's why I'm doing it."" The two men had met in grade school in Burbank, California. They remained friends through high school but afterward went their separate ways. Loutensock was living in Utah with his wife and children when word came to him that Landros was ill. He immediately decided he would help if he could, and when testing determined he was a good match he spent two years losing 40 pounds and undergoing rigorous physical training to prepare for the surgery. Landros was overwhelmed to learn that his old friend, whom he had not seen in many years, had come forward to help him. ""It's hard to put into words someone wanting to do this much for you,"" he says. ""Saying thank you' seems so inadequate."" Forty-six years after they first men, Landros and Loutensock were together at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where Dr. Albin Gritsch, surgical director of the UCLA Kidney Transplant Program, would oversee the operation. First, Loutensock underwent laparoscopic surgery to remove one of his kidneys. Then, Landros received the transplant. ""With a living donor kidney transplant, it's particularly special,"" says Dr. Gritsch. ""Blyden's kidney worked right away, and it started to clean Alan's blood right away.

The diagnosis: hemorrhaging in his brain caused by a cavernous angioma, a potentially fatal or debilitating condition. The decision was made to transfer Donaven from a Las Vegas hospital, to Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA, where he could be treated by neurosurgeon, Dr. Jorge Lazareff. Cavernous angiomas can occur anywhere in the central nervous system and affect, 1 in 100-200 people between the ages of 20 to 30 years. About 11 percent of cases are asymptomatic, but symptoms can include weakness in the arms or legs; vision loss; balance, memory and attention problems; or headaches, seizures, stroke, and hemorrhages. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to diagnose the condition. In Donaven's case, the clusters of abnormal blood vessels made up of little bubbles (caverns), were filled with blood, causing hemorrhaging in his brain. Dr. Lazareff and his team surgically removed the abnormal coil of blood vessels from Donaven's brain using brain mapping during a craniotomy, or opening of the skull, which is performed under general anesthesia. After nine hours of successful surgery and two days of recovery, Donaven was able to walk out of the hospital. ""I experienced the compassion and love that employees at UCLA have for their patients and family members. I have not seen this type of care in a long time. Parents should know that there is a place they can feel their child is safe and well cared for. I owe everything to Dr. Lazareff and the teams at UCLA for their support,"" says Malia. The whole experience convinced Malia and her husband, Logan Hookano, to pull up their roots in Las Vegas and move to Los Angeles to be a part of the UCLA family and to help other families experience the kind of ""comfort, care and love"" they received from Dr. Lazareff and his team. ""I would walk to the end of the world for my son, and if UCLA was in China, we would be in China now,"" says Logan. Malia is now a surgical technician for UCLA's Jules Stein Eye Institute and Logan is a cook in the Department of Nutrition at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. And Donaven is a thriving teenager with his own dreams for the future.

Strategies that would improve the delivery of anti-cancer agents specifically to tumor cells would not only increase the effectiveness of a chemotherapy, but also would reduce its systemic toxicity. A molecular vehicle is needed that could target tumor cells - nanoparticles provide such a potential vehicle. Nanoparticles can loosely be defined as synthetic structures with dimensions ranging from 1-100 nanometers (a nanometer is one-billionth of a meter, about the size of a water molecule), whose unique properties, at least in part, depend on their physical size and component chemistry. Many contain a hollow core into which a wide range of cargo can be packaged. Dr. Federman will develop and test targeted nanoparticles to treat pediatric sarcomas (aggressive and often lethal bone and soft tissue cancers), in which the survival rate for patients is less than 20% despite incredibly aggressive chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation treatments. This completely novel and high-risk project would be a breakthrough in our current treatment of pediatric cancers, leading to the development of powerful new therapeutic strategies in aggressive childhood malignancies.

Recent advances in artificial intraocular lens (IOL) designs, however, may reduce or eliminate the need for glasses following surgery. The newer premium lenses enhance the optics of the eyes and make people less dependent on glasses, explains ophthalmologist Kevin Miller, M.D., one of the several physicians with the Jules Stein Eye Institute at UCLA who provide the new lenses. Premium IOLs are designed to correct either astigmatism or presbyopia. Astigmatism-correcting lenses adjust for blurred vision resulting from an irregular-shaped cornea. Presbyopia-correcting lenses adjust for the inability of the eye to change focus. The decision to place a premium IOL, as opposed to a standard lens, is dictated by patient preference and preoperative clinical findings. The nature and scope of visual impairment before surgery is a good indicator as to the extent to which the lens will improve the quality of vision, Dr. Miller says. For example, with the astigmatism-correcting lens, patients must have enough astigmatism to justify placing it. For the presbyopia-correcting lens, patients must have decent visual potential. Currently, less than 10 percent of cataract surgery patients receive premium IOLs, but Dr. Miller expects that number to increase as the potential benefits become more widely known. While perfect vision is hard to achieve, the goal is to help patients see without glasses after surgery, Dr. Miller says.

The UCLA Department of Radiation Oncology is the first center in the Los Angeles area to install the Novalis Tx, a noninvasive stereotactic radiosurgery machine that includes three imaging modalities. The modalities track the location of tumors during respiration and other movement and allow physicians to pinpoint the tumor and position the patient so that radiation is delivered with the highest precision to the cancerous tissue while protecting the healthy surrounding tissues. The Novalis Tx has an advanced system that continuously shapes the radiation beam to mirror the tumor's size and dimensions as the machine rotates around the patient, delivering treatment from different angles. In addition, the platform holding the patient moves not only side to side and up and down but also rotates around a vertical axis. Physicians using the machine have likened it to a high-performance sports car with all the bells and whistles that make such a vehicle desirable. ""This Novalis Tx is like having a really nice BMW. With it, you get all the basic features of stereotactic radiosurgery, but you also get all these amazing high-tech accessories,"" said Dr. Percy Lee, assistant professor of radiation oncology at UCLA and director of the stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) program, which will employ the Novalis Tx to treat localized tumors. ""This machine has state-of-the-art features like the multiple imaging modalities to cover every clinical circumstance and make it more precise and accurate."" In some cases, the Novalis Tx can reduce the period of radiation needed from six weeks of daily treatments to just three to five days because of the high doses that can be delivered using the SBRT approach, Lee said. This results in less radiation to the neighboring normal tissues, greatly reducing side effects while also improving tumor control rates.

But few challenges would be as difficult as the diagnosis he received last year of prostate cancer. Barrys cancer was diagnosed following a test called a PSA, or prostate-specific antigen test, which measures a protein produced by the prostate that is elevated in most men with prostate cancer. A rising PSA indicates the likelihood of a growing cancer, and the faster it rises, the more aggressive the cancer is likely to be. He was horrified when he heard the news. Both of my parents died of cancer, and my sister has had her breasts removed so cancer is prevalent in my family, and it was a very traumatic thing to be told, he recalls. Prostate cancer is one of the most-common cancers affecting men. Each year, 220,000 new cases are diagnosed and 29,000 men die from the disease. But that number is down from 40,000 deaths 10 years ago, potentially because of the kind of screening that Barry received. Barry and his physician, UCLA urologist Dr. Robert Reiter, who is the director of the Prostate Cancer Treatment Program at UCLA, talked about his options for treatment, including radiation and different types of surgery. After much discussion, both Barry and Dr. Reiter felt that surgery, using the latest in robotic technology, to remove his cancerous prostate would be Barrys best choice. The technique is minimally invasive, meaning it is performed through small holes in the abdomen through which a camera and instruments are inserted. The instruments have wrist-like joints and can move in all directions, giving the surgeon maximum flexibility and accuracy of movement. In addition, the camera provides three-dimensional images, offering the surgeon an improved visual field as he works the instruments. And because a long incision is not necessary, there is much less blood loss and patients generally experience less pain and faster recovery, often returning home the next day and back to most activities within a few weeks. The efficacy of the surgery is further enhanced at UCLA by the integration of magnetic resonance imaging, which reduces the risks of leaving cancer behind and improves the chances of sexual recovery. After his surgery, Barry was up and walking the next day. He quickly regained urinary and sexual function, and, most important to him and his family, Barry is now cancer free. Theyve got the old guy still around for a while, and were looking for grandchildren one of these days, so we want to be around to be able to enjoy them, Barry says. Thats the deal.

But new medications, a focus on increased intake of calcium and vitamin D, and more vigilant assessment of bone-mineral density and future fracture risk are among the latest treatments for the skeletal disorder, which is characterized by compromised bone strength that predisposes a person to greater risk of fracture. This is a very common problem. Patients should discuss their risks with their physicians, says UCLA endocrinologist Sheila Ahmadi, M.D. About half of all white women will experience a fracture associated with osteoporosis in her lifetime. Osteoporosis also occurs in older men, who are less likely to be screened or treated for the condition, and who have a higher death rate as a consequence of hip fractures. Regular weight-bearing exercise and getting adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D can help prevent the development of osteoporosis, and should start at an early age, says Aurelia Nattiv, M.D., director of the UCLA Osteoporosis Center in Santa Monica. People used to think of osteoporosis as a geriatric problem, but bone health begins in childhood, she says. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D are particularly important preventative factors. The National Osteoporosis Foundation updated recommended daily requirements in 2008: 1,200 mg of calcium and 800-1,000 IU of vitamin D for adults 50 years or older; 1,000 mg of calcium and 400-800 IU of vitamin D for adults under 50; and 1,300 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D for children and adolescents ages 9-18. Doses for younger children vary by age. Most people, however, fail to meet the recommended daily requirements, and daily supplements often are necessary to reach those levels, Dr. Nattiv says. Most current guidelines recommend screening for osteoporosis in all women over the age of 65 and for younger women and older men with risk factors for osteoporosis. The gold standard for diagnosis, assessment of risk and monitoring of treatment is dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), a noninvasive scan. Several drugs can slow and in some cases reverse the process of bone loss. The mainstays are the drugs known as bisphosphonates ‚Äî pills that are taken daily, weekly or in some cases monthly. A once-a-year injectable medication also is available, and other promising new drugs are currently in clinical trials. Despite the growing number of treatment options, a general lack of awareness about osteoporosis seems to exist among large segments of the at-risk population, says geriatrician Deborah Kado, M.D. Osteoporosis, much like hypertension, is something you can walk around with and not realize you have, Dr. Kado explains. Many people dont know they have low bone density until they have a fracture ‚Äî and even then, they may not realize that there is more that can and should be done than getting a cast or having surgery.

But thanks to progress in diagnosis, surgical techniques and postoperative care, up to 90 percent of these infants born today will live to become adults. Advances in the ability to treat congenital defects make prenatal diagnosis of the problem more critical than ever, says Brian Reemtsen, M.D., director of the Congenital Heart Surgery Program at Mattel Childrens Hospital UCLA. For these very sick patients, he adds, optimal care is provided when we know what to expect from the patient before birth. Dr. Reemtsen stresses the importance of proper prenatal care, including routine ultrasounds. A family history of congenital heart disease and the detection of any other anomaly in the course of these screenings are among the biggest risk factors for congenital heart disease. Identifying babies with congenital heart defects in utero can be life saving, says Thomas Klitzner, M.D., Ph.D., chief of pediatric cardiology at UCLA. Cutting-edge imaging technologies ‚Äî such as fetal echocardiography, three-dimensional echocardiography and the ability to see increasingly smaller structures on CT scans and cardiac MRI ‚Äî have greatly enhanced physicians ability to view the anatomy of the fetal and infant heart, which is roughly the size of a walnut. Hypoplastic-left-heart syndrome, among the most-common congenital defects, was considered a fatal disease two decades ago; today, though they require multiple surgeries, the vast majority of these children survive into adulthood. The key is not only good surgery, but also excellent pre- and postoperative care, Dr. Reemtsen explains. That is where the multidisciplinary approach makes all the difference for these extremely sick patients. At Mattel Childrens Hospital UCLA, for example, the Congenital Heart Surgery Program benefits from partnerships with the Interventional Cardiology Program, where advances in the use of balloons and catheters have improved postsurgical care; and the Pediatric Electrophysiology Program, where experts are available to treat arrhythmias. In addition, labor-and-delivery at UCLA is on the same floor as the Pediatric Heart Center so that any procedure needed for an infant can be done without delay or the need to transfer from one facility to another. Patients who require it also benefit from advances in heart transplantation. Recent developments include the advent of a pediatric ventricular-assist device. The Berlin Heart is the first such device made specifically for the pediatric population. It is helping to serve as a bridge for patients with failing hearts who might otherwise die while waiting for a transplant. read more at www.uclahealth.org/vitalsigns","UCLA,pediatric cardiology,congenital heart disease,Brian Reemsten,Thomas Klitzner",28,"Science & Technology","Health,Knowledge",PT3M38S,218,2d,sd,false,,,,,,,,6546,16,,0,9

A minimally invasive alternative to conventional open surgery can help people who suffer from Dupuytrens contracture, a debilitating condition that results in one or more fingers becoming permanently bent. Dupuytrens contracture is an often-inherited progressive condition in which cords of tissue in the palm thicken and shorten, pulling fingers into a bent position that cannot be straightened. The bending usually occurs in the knuckle or middle joints of the ring finger and pinkie, but other fingers and joints may also be involved. While the condition is rarely painful, bent fingers complicate a patients life, says Prosper Benhaim, M.D., UCLA hand and reconstructive surgeon. Everyday activities such as shaking hands, putting on gloves and using a computer keyboard are very difficult. It is easy to poke yourself in the eye while just combing your hair. Conventional open surgery to correct the condition involves a sometimes large incision in the palm and fingers to remove diseased tissue. Recovery can take several months, and some patients experience complications such as nerve damage, infection, stiffness or a chronic-pain syndrome called reflex sympathetic dystrophy. The alternative procedure is called needle aponeurotomy; it is has been performed in Europe since the 1970s, but only recently has been introduced to the United States. Dr. Benhaim is one of the few surgeons in the United States to do the procedure. Rather than cutting into the hand, the surgeon inserts a needle, under local anesthesia, into the palm to divide, loosen and then break the contracted tissue, allowing the fingers to again lie flat. Compared to conventional surgery for Dupuytrens contracture, needle aponeurotomy is fast (as little as 10 minutes to complete), has a shorter recovery period (seven to 10 days, with no rehabilitation necessary and little or no need for pain medication) and has fewer complications, and it is much less expensive. However, not all patients with Dupuytrens contracture are good candidates for needle aponeurotomy. The best candidates are those in which the contracture is isolated to the knuckle joint, close to the palm, Dr. Benhaim says. Patients with contracture in the middle joint of the finger are sometimes poor candidates due to proximity of a nerve. And needle aponeurotomy is not without risk, Dr. Benhaim cautions. It is a blind procedure, meaning that the surgeon works under closed skin and is not able to visualize the tissue; he must rely on his experience, knowledge of anatomy and expertise to ensure that he does not damage tendons or nerves. Fortunately, the risk of a significant complication is less than one percent overall, Dr. Benhaim says. In addition, as with conventional open surgery, the condition may reappear and the procedure may need to be repeated. Unlike conventional surgery, however, repeat aponeurotomy can be performed much more easily several times over the course of a patients lifetime, Dr. Benhaim notes.","frozen fingers,needle aponeurotomy,Dupuytren's contracture,bent fingers,Prosper Benhaim",28,"Science & Technology","Health,Knowledge",PT4M34S,274,2d,sd,false,,,,,,,,39151,110,,0,14

Today, LASIK surgery utilizes lasers instead of blades to create a thin flap in the cornea of the eye and then precisely custom sculpt the cornea to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism, explains D. Rex Hamilton, M.D., director of the UCLA Laser Refractive Center. A recent study by the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery finds that more than 95 percent of patients who have undergone LASIK are pleased with the results, andDr. Hamilton notes that most patients experience minimal discomfort from the procedure, which is done under topical anesthesia and takes just seven to 10 minutes per eye. While LASIK can be successful in many cases, not everyone who wants to give up their glasses or contact lenses is a good candidate, Dr. Hamilton says. In addition to the amount of correction that is required, Dr. Hamilton explains, the anatomy of the eye, such as the thickness and shape of the cornea, among other factors, is also an important consideration. Other ocular health problems such as cataracts or untreated glaucoma may also contraindicate the procedure. Dr. Hamilton counsels patients who are considering LASIK to look at not only the experience of the surgeon but also at the quality of the equipment that the surgeon is using. The most current equipment, such as that used by the UCLA Laser Refractive Center, enables the surgeon to better tailor procedures to each individual patient. You want to choose a place that spends a lot of time on the diagnostic side and that has the right equipment to determine what is necessary, he says.","LASIK,surgery,eye,cornea,laser,UCLA,Dr.,Rex,Hamilton,vision",28,"Science & Technology","Health,Knowledge",PT3M39S,219,2d,sd,false,,,,,,,,2876,9,,0,1

Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA OVERVIEW: Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA is uniquely designed to care for the physical and emotional well-being of children of all ages, from newborns to young adults. Located on the third and fifth floors of the new Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, a butterfly canopy on Gayley Avenue marks the separate entrance to the Children's Hospital. An innovative multi-media ""Welcome Wall"" greets patients, families, visitors and staff to the Hospital. Child-friendly d√©cor begins in the lobby and continues throughout the upper floors. The state-of-the-art facility is designed to serve the most critically ill children with sophisticated, compassionate pediatric care in an environment that is both welcoming and healing to children and their families. ADDRESS: 757 Westwood Plaza (Gayley Entrance) Los Angeles, CA 90095 WEBSITE: www.uclahealth.org/Mattel CAPACITY: Current bed capacity is 90 inpatient beds, including a 24-bed Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and a 22-bed Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Future plans involve the addition of 10 more beds. FUNDING: Mattel Children's Foundation, a philanthropic arm of Mattel, Inc. committed to improving the lives of children, pledged $25 million toward construction of a new children's hospital at UCLA. ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN: UCLA's world-renowned design team aimed to create a cheerful and reassuring environment for sick and injured children and their concerned families. Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA has its own distinctive entrance on Gayley Avenue designed to be inviting to children, with an interactive welcome wall that tells the stories of some of its young patients. A large terrace on the fifth floor allows children direct access to the outdoors so that they can play in the sunshine. Patient rooms benefit from an abundance of natural light and a sense of plentiful space with large windows that overlook gardens, green spaces and gathering places. SPECIAL FEATURES: The lobby welcomes patients and visitors with a dynamic, multi-media, 60-foot-long, 12-foot-high ""Welcome Wall"" -- an evolving stream of photos, children's art and video content that projects stories about the people and programs at Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA, along with messages of hope, healing and recovery. Providing a special place for creative expression, a pillar alongside the ""Welcome Wall"" features a view port into which kids can peek and then find their own image projected on the screens, becoming a part of the wall themselves. The space and media elements engage children and families while creating a special identity for the hospital within Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Creating a home-like atmosphere for children, the third and fifth floors address the social and emotional needs of children and families in the hospital with design features such as a large map of the world and impressive aquarium. Specialists provide individualized therapeutic intervention, play and educational programs. Architects incorporated the beauty of the outdoors and sunlight into the space to enhance the healing process. Multiple age-appropriate playrooms and a family resource room extend to a large outdoor play terrace with ocean views and eight-foot plexi glass walls. The outdoor area allows children to safely play in the open air and enjoy the healing effects of natural light. A multi-media room on the third floor gives teens a special place to play video games or watch movies. At Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA, form truly follows function. Each nursing unit has its own minor procedure room so young patients can undergo certain treatments away from their sleeping area to avoid associating pain or distress with their own room. Spacious private patient rooms feature large windows with panoramic views and a window seat with a daybed so family members can comfortably spend time in the room. To help ease the anxiety of sick and frightened children, the Emergency Department features pediatricfriendly exam rooms with colorful murals and decorated ceiling tiles.

At UCLA, for example, transplant experts are studying a program they call ""living donor swap."" This program enables the relative or friend of a kidney transplant patient who is not compatible as a donor to ""swap"" organs with another potential donor who also may be an incompatible match for his or her relative or friend. This greatly broadens the pool of organs available from living donors. ""Swapping organs makes sense in such cases,"" says Albin Gritsch, M.D., UCLA urologist. In the case of a ""living donor swap,"" both transplants are done simultaneously, Dr. Gritsch explains. Advances in livingdonor- transplant technology make the surgery less invasive and the pain easier to manage. UCLA has been among the pioneers in the field of kidney transplantation, and consistently ranks among the top five centers nationally. Currently, about two-thirds of kidney transplants are performed with organs taken from deceased donors, explains UCLA nephrologist Alan Wilkinson, M.D., and the wait can often be as long as five years, making living-donor transplantation an attractive alternative. Living donors, often family or friends of the transplant patient, currently account for about one third of cases. The door to increasing living-donor transplantation also has been opened wider with pioneering surgical techniques, including laparoscopic harvesting of donor kidneys, which results in less pain and a quicker recovery, notes Gabriel Danovitch, M.D., director of Kidney and Kidney/Pancreas Transplantation at UCLA.","kidney,transplant,living,donor,swap,transplantation",22,"People & Blogs","Health,Society",PT7M42S,462,2d,sd,false,,,,,,,,8372,19,,0,3

The project aims to serve as a model for other medical institutions interested in helping additional wounded service members.","wounded,military,plastic,surgery,ucla,operation,mend",22,"People & Blogs","Health,Military,Society",PT4M39S,279,2d,sd,false,,,,,,,,3558,11,,0,0

Pei and his son, C.C. Pei, has taken hospital design to a whole new level; it will deliver world-class medical treatment using cutting-edge technology in a compassionate, patient-focused environment. With 520 large, sunny, private patient rooms featuring terrific views and daybeds for family members, wireless Internet access for patients and guests, multiple outdoor play areas for children and more, the new building maximizes personal attention and holistic healing. This is one of the first total replacement hospital projects to be built in accordance with the latest California seismic safety requirements as a result of the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The one million-plus square foot, 10-story structure (eight above ground) is situated on four acres at the southwest corner of Westwood Plaza and Charles E. Young Drive South. The hospital encompasses the operations of Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, Stewart and Lynda Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital at UCLA and Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA. Four hospital entrances efficiently serve distinct patient populations: pediatric patients enter the Mattel Children's Hospital through a less intimidating entrance off Gayley Avenue, trauma patients arrive via Charles E. Young Drive South or the heliport, psychiatric patients enter through a south entrance linked to UCLA Medical Plaza, and all other patients enter off Westwood Plaza. The lobbies are interconnected by a wide corridor to allow people to easily navigate around the facility.","Ronald,Reagan,UCLA,Medical,Center,Hospital",22,"People & Blogs","Health,Society",PT8M47S,527,2d,sd,false,,,,,,,,6490,16,,0,1
